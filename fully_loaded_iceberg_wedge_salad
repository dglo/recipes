YIELD: Serves 4
ACTIVE TIME: 25 minutes
TOTAL TIME: 25 minutes

2 small tomatoes (about 8 ounces total), diced
Kosher salt
1 small red onion, minced
White wine vinegar, for soaking onion (see note above)
4 ounces sliced bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
2 ounces fresh bread crumbs (about 1/2 cup)
Freshly ground black pepper
2 ounces mild blue cheese
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 tablespoon fresh juice from 1 lemon
1 head iceberg lettuce, outer leaves discarded and quartered through core so that each quarter holds together
Minced chives, for garnish

Set a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and add diced tomatoes. Sprinkle
liberally with salt, and toss to combine. In a small bowl, add onion and
pour enough vinegar on top to cover. Let tomatoes and onions stand while you
prep the other ingredients.

In a small skillet, cook bacon over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally,
until crisped, about 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper
towel-lined plate to drain. You should have about 2 tablespoons rendered fat
in the skillet. Add bread crumbs and cook over medium heat, stirring
frequently, until browned and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a paper
towel-lined plate to drain and season liberally with salt and pepper.

In a medium bowl, mash blue cheese with a whisk. Whisk in mayonnaise, sour
cream, buttermilk, and lemon juice until a smooth, slightly lumpy dressing
forms. Season with pepper (the blue cheese will likely make the dressing
salty enough, but taste and add salt if necessary).

Arrange iceberg wedges on plates and spoon dressing on each. Drain
quick-pickled onions and sprinkle all over salads, along with drained 
tomatoes (discard any extracted liquid), bacon, toasted bread crumbs, and
chives. Serve.
