Heat olive or vegetable oil in the saute pan over medium. Saute the chopped
onion for 7-8 minutes till it softens. Add the garlic and saute for 2 minutes
more, until fragrant.

Add the zucchini and continue to saute for about 5 more minutes till zucchini
starts to soften.

Add the tomatoes and beans to the pan, stir to combine. Let the mixture simmer
for about 10 minutes longer, stirring occasionally, till the zucchini is
cooked and the medley is heated through.

Stir in the chopped cilantro. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add
cayenne or hot sauce to taste, if desired (optional). Cayenne is extremely
spicy, add with care.

Serve vegetable medley over hot steamed rice. Top with shredded cheddar cheese
or garnish with additional chopped cilantro, if desired. The rice and the
beans combine to create a complete protein, making this a healthy vegetarian
entree.
