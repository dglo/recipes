Jalapeno-Red Bean-BBQ Burgers Recipe #88294

Moist, delicious vegetarian alternative to boring frozen veggie burgers.
These are easy to make and taste wonderful on whole-grain buns with some
cheddar cheese, tomato and lettuce for crunch. Be watchful while cooking
these ... the sugar content in the barbecue sauce can cause the burgers to
blacken kind of quickly. Tastes great on the grill, too ... just keep an
eye on them!

31 min | 25 min prep | SERVES 4

1    teaspoon olive oil
1/2  cup minced onions
1/2  cup chopped and seeded plum tomatoes
1    teaspoon minced jalapeno chiles, more if you like   or serrano peppers
1    clove garlic, minced
1    teaspoon chili powder
1 (15    ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed,well drained
1/4  cup dry breadcrumbs
2    tablespoons barbecue sauce  (I like homemade or Uncle Dougie's, a brand out of Barrington, IL)
1    egg white, beaten
4    whole grain buns, toasted

Heat oil in nonstick skillet over medium heat.
Add next onion, plum tomato, jalapeno, garlic and chili powder; saute 5 minutes.
Cool slightly.
Using fork, coarsely mash beans in bowl.
Combine with onion mixture, breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons of the barbecue sauce
and egg white.
Shape mixture into four 1/2-inch-thick patties.
(Can be prepared 4 hours ahead. Cover and chill.) It will look as though these
little burgers will just fall apart and turn to mush, but they stay together
really well once they"hit the pan"!
If grilling, oil the rack or spray grill rack with nonstick spray, then fire up
coals to medium heat.
If pan-frying, heat a little olive oil over medium heat.
Place patties on grill or in skillet and cook until golden brown and heated
through, about three minutes per side.
Place burgers on buns.
Serve with more barbecue sauce, and cheese, tomato, lettuce, avocado, or
whatever topping you like!
