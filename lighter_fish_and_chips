Lighter Oven Fried Fish
Best of Cook's Illustrated Light

1(5-ounce) box plain Melba toast , broken into 1-inch pieces
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 large egg whites
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme leaves
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 1-inch-thick cod fillets (about 6 ounces each)
Vegetable cooking spray
Table salt and ground black pepper
1 lemon cut into wedges for serving

1. Adjust an oven rack to the upper-middle position and heat the oven to
   450 degrees. Cover a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top.
   Process the Melba toast into coarse crumbs in a food processor, about
   twelve 1-second pulses. Spread the crumbs in a shallow dish and toss with
   the oil. 

2. In a separate shallow dish, whisk the egg whites, mustard, thyme, garlic
   powder, and cayenne together.

3. Pat the cod dry with paper towels then season with salt and pepper. Working
   with one piece of fish at a time, dip it into the egg white mixture, then
   coat with the Melba crumbs. Press on the Melba crumbs to make sure they
   adhere to the fish. Lay the coated fish onto the prepared wire rack and
   spray the tops with vegetable oil spray.

4. Bake until the coating is golden and the fish just flakes apart, 12 to 15
   minutes. Serve with the lemon wedges and Tartar Sauce.
