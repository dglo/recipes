Apple and Parmesan Risotto with Almonds
serves 2 as a main dish

2 tbsp butter
1 shallot, finely chopped
1 Granny Smith apple, peeled and diced
1/2 lemon, zest and juice
6 oz Arborio rice
1/3 c white wine
1-1/4 to 1-3/4 c vegetable stock
pinch of chili flakes
Salt and pepper
2 tbsp cold butter
2 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
3 tbsp heavy cream
2 tbsp toasted almonds, roughly chopped

Heat two tablespoons of butter in a wide saucepan. Add the shallot and cook for
2 minutes. Squeeze lemon juice over diced apples so they do not oxidize. Add
apples to the pan along with lemon zest. Cook for 2-3 minutes, just until the
apples release their sweet flavor. Add rice and cook, stirring constantly,
until the rice is all covered in butter. Add wine and cook until the alcohol
evaporates. Season with a generous pinch of salt, some freshly ground pepper
and chili flakes. Now reduce the heat and start adding stock, one ladle at the
time. Cook, stirring frequently until the rice is cooked al dente.

Once the rice is cooked, stir in cold butter and grated Parmesan cheese.
Remove from heat and stir in heavy cream. Serve immediately sprinkled with
toasted almonds and some rocket leaves. The risotto is served with some
spectacular balsamic reduction sauce.
