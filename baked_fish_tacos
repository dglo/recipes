1 lb cod fillet, cut into 8-10 strips (Tilapia, Halibut or Flounder may be used)
Salt
Pepper
Garlic powder
Cayenne pepper
2 eggs
1/4 cup flour
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.

Cut the fish fillet evenly into 8-10 strips. Season both sides with a good
amount of salt, pepper, garlic powder and cayenne pepper.   Prepare the flour,
egg and panko in separate bowls. Dredge each piece in flour and shake off
excess, dip it in egg then coat with panko bread crumbs. Set aside in the
fridge. Work on the rest of the fixings. When oven is ready, place the fish on
a greased baking sheet. With a baking/cooking spray, spray all over the top of
the fish. Pop the fish in the oven for 15-20 minutes placed at the upper most
rack of the oven.
