Tuna Cakes
1 large egg
1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
3 scallions, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
2 teaspoons chili-garlic sauce
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 (5-oz) cans solid white albacore tuna in water, drained and flaked
1 tablespoon canola oil

Mayo
2 tablespoons nonfat Greek yogurt
2 tablespoons light mayonnaise
1 teaspoon sriracha sauce
zest of half of a lime
juice of half a lime

Whisk the egg and panko together in a medium bowl. Stir in the scallions,
cilantro, sesame oil, chili-garlic sauce and black pepper. Add the tuna and
gently mix until incorporated. Divide the mixture into four equal portions,
and shape each portion into a patty. Refrigerate the patties for at least 15
minutes.

Set a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the oil. When it
shimmers, add the patties. Cook for about 5 minutes total, flipping halfway
through, or until the patties are golden brown on both sides. Carefully remove
them from the pan.

To make the sauce: Stir together all of the ingredients in a bowl â€“ you can
add more or less sriracha than called for, depending on how spicy you want
the sauce. Serve a dollop on each tuna cake.
