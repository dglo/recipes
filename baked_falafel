Baked Falafel
Makes about 21 balls

1 15 ounce can garbanzo beans
1 small onion, finely chopped
2-3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
3 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
1 tablespoon fresh cilantro, chopped
1 teaspoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon coriander
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes
2 tablespoons flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
Salt and pepper to taste

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Drain and rinse the garbanzo beans. Put in a
medium sized bowl and smash with a fork. Add the rest of the ingredients and
mix well. Form into small balls, about 1 1/2" in diameter and slightly
flatten. Place onto an oiled baking pan.

Bake for 15 minutes on each side, until nicely browned (since it's baked, only
the part actually touching the pan will be browned and crispy).

Serve with mini pita pockets, hummus, tahini sauce, tomatoes, lettuce and/or
cucumber.

Tahini Sauce

1 cube tahini
1 clove garlic
1-2 tsp olive oil
1/4 tsp parsley
