Prep Time: 0 hours, 5 minutes

Ingredients:

1 Bottle of red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Rioja, Zinfandel, Shiraz)
1 Lemon cut into wedges
1 Orange cut into wedges
1 Lime cut into wedges
2 Tbsp sugar
Splash of orange juice
2 Shots of gin
1 Cup of sliced strawberries or raspberries (may use thawed or frozen)
1 Small can of diced pineapples (with juice)
4 Cups ginger ale
Preparation:

Pour wine in the pitcher and squeeze the juice wedges from the lemon, orange
and lime into the wine. Toss in the fruit wedges (leaving out seeds if
possible) and pineapple then add sugar, orange juice and gin. Chill overnight.
Add ginger ale, berries and ice just before serving. If you'd like to serve
right away, use chilled red wine and serve over lots of ice. However, remember
that the best Sangrias are chilled around 24 hours in the frig. - allowing the
flavors to really marinate into each other.
