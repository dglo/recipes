Prep Time: 12 mins
Cook Time: 40 mins
Serves: 4

1 cup whole milk
Salt and pepper
1 cup yellow whole-grain cornmeal
2 strips bacon
2 red and/or orange bell peppers, seeded and sliced
4 scallions, thinly sliced
1 pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 teaspoon hot cayenne pepper sauce
1/4 cup grated Parmesan

In a large pan, bring milk, 3 cups water and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil. Add
cornmeal in a steady stream, whisking, until no lumps are visible. Cover,
reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring and scraping pan every 10 minutes,
until tender, 35 minutes. Uncover; cook 5 minutes longer, stirring.

While grits cook, fry bacon in a large skillet over medium heat, turning,
until crisp, 5 to 6 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Let cool; crumble.

Add bell peppers, white parts of scallions, 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon
pepper to skillet with bacon fat. Sauté until bell peppers are crisp-tender,
7 minutes. Stir in shrimp, pepper sauce and 1/2 cup water. Sauté until shrimp
turn almost opaque, 3 minutes. Remove from heat.

Remove grits from heat; stir in cheese. Divide among 4 bowls; top with shrimp
mixture. Garnish with bacon and scallion greens.
