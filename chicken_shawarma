Chicken Shawarma

2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts
4 bell peppers, julienned
1 large red onion, sliced thinly lengthwise
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, divided
4 tsp cumin
4 tsp paprika
1 tsp allspice
1 1/2 tsp turmeric
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp cinnamon
Pinch of cayenne
Salt and black pepper
Hummus
Pita bread
Feta cheese, optional
Fresh basil/cilantro, optional

Make two separate batches of the marinade: in 2 separate small bowls, whisk
together 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp allspice,
3/4 tsp turmeric, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, pinch of cayenne,
1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper. Place chicken in a zip-loc bag or bowl and
pour one of the bowls over the chicken. Ensure the pieces are coated evenly
and refrigerate for 1 hour or overnight. Cover other bowl of marinade and set
aside to used for vegetables.

Grill the chicken: heat grill to medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook
until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.

Oven-cook the chicken: Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Place chicken on a baking
sheet.  Roast about 15 minutes until cooked through, turning pieces halfway
through cooking.

Transfer chicken to a plate and cover with aluminum foil and allow meat to
rest for 10 minutes.

Saute the vegetables: Add about 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a large skillet
and heat over medium-high heat. When skillet is hot, add the peppers and onion
and the other bowl of marinade. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon to ensure
vegetables are evenly coated. Turn down the heat of the stove to medium and
cook until peppers and onions are soft, about 10-15 minutes. Remove from heat.

Plate and enjoy: After the chicken rests, cut into strips. Swirl a generous
amount of hummus on a plate or bowl. Add a scoop of the saut√©ed vegetables and
then a few pieces of chicken. Top with feta cheese and fresh basil or
cilantro. Serve with pita bread. Enjoy!
