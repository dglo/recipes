Hasselback Kielbasa
https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020004-hasselback-kielbasa

1 kielbasa
1 small onion
1 bell pepper
2 tbsp apricot preserves
2 tbsp mustard

Get a sheet pan ripping hot in a 425-degree oven while you cut up a small
onion and a bell pepper, whatever color you prefer. Toss the vegetables in a
splash of neutral oil, salt and pepper them, and tip them into a single layer
on the hot pan.

Allow these to roast in the oven while you cut the kielbasa into thin slices,
stopping short of cutting all the way through the meat. You want to end up
with a long accordion, basically, or an attenuated pill bug.

Remove the vegetables from the oven, give them a stir, and put the kielbasa on
top. Return the sheet pan to the oven and allow everything to roast into crisp
softness, 20 to 25 minutes, basting heavily two or three times with a mixture
of equal parts apricot preserves and mustard, about 2 tablespoons each.

Serve with steamed greens or a fresh baguette.
