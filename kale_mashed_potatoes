PREP TIME: 10 mins
COOK TIME: 25 mins
SERVINGS: 4 to 6 servings

For a variation, sub out half of the potatoes with parsnips. Can add chives,
leeks, or bacon too.

4 russet potatoes (2 to 2 1/2 pounds), peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces
Salt, to taste
5 to 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for serving
3 lightly packed cups chopped kale, cabbage, chard, or other leafy green
3 green onions, minced (about 1/2 cup)
1 cup milk or cream

Put the potatoes in a medium pot and cover with cold water by at least an inch.
Add 2 tablespoons of salt, and bring to a boil. Boil until the potatoes are fork
tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain in a colander.

Return the pot to the stove and set over medium-high heat. Melt the butter in
the pot and once it's hot, add the greens. Cook the greens for 3 to 4 minutes,
or until they are wilted and have given off some of their water. Add the green
onions and cook 1 minute more.

Pour in the milk or cream, mix well, and add the potatoes. Reduce the heat to
medium. Use a fork or potato masher and mash the potatoes, mixing them up with the
greens. Add salt to taste and serve hot, with a knob of butter in the center.
