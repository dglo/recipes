BLACK BEAN MOLE BURGERS
Serves 4

1-1/2 C Cooked black beans/ 1 can
1/4 C Mole sauce (see below)
1/3 C Chopped green onions
1/4 C Fresh coriander
1/2 tsp Ground cumin
1/4 tsp Chipotle chili powder
1/2 tsp Salt
1/2 C Rolled oats
1/3 C Diced bell pepper (any colour, or a combination)

FOR THE MOLE SAUCE
1/2 Tbsp Olive oil
1 Medium onion, diced
1 Clove of garlic, minced
2 Tbsp Mild chili powder
1 Tbsp Coconut sugar
1/4 tsp Cinnamon
1/4 tsp Chipotle chili powder
1/16 tsp Ground cloves
1/2 400g/14oz Can of chopped tomatoes
1-1/2 Tbsp Cocoa powder
1-1/2 Tbsp Peanut OR Almond butter
Salt & pepper, to taste

(If baking the burgers preheat oven to 200C/400F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper)
Make the mole sauce first.
In a medium-sized pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring for approx 5 minutes, until translucent. Add the garlic, sugar and spices and continue to cook for a further minute. Add the remaining ingredients, bring to a simmer and cook on low for 10-15 minutes. Set aside.
For the burgers, in a food processor blend the first seven ingredients (black beans through to salt) until you have a chunky puree. Pulse in the oats and finally stir through the diced pepper.
For four large burgers, use a 1/3 C measuring cup to divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and flatten into thick patties.
Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat, cook the burgers for approx 6-8 minutes on each side, or until brown. Alternatively, place the patties on the prepared baking sheet and bake for approx 30 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking.
Serve burgers topped with the remaining mole sauce and sliced avocado (essentials!) plus your favourite burger toppings- vegan sour cream, sliced tomato, onion, etc.
NOTES
These freeze well either after cooking and cooling or pre-cooking. Just lay them on a parchment-lined tray and stick the whole thing in the freezer. When solid, remove them from the tray and store them in a freezer bag.
