2 cups heavy cream
2/3 cup granulated sugar
1 Tbsp lemon zest, grated
6 Tbsp lemon juice, freshly squeezed
1 1/2 cups strawberries, blueberries, blackberries

In a medium sauce pan, combine cream, sugar and lemon zest. Bring to a boil
over medium heat. Continue boiling, stirring often until sugar is dissolved.
If mixture starts to boil over, carefully remove from heat. Continue to boil
until mixture is reduced to 2 cups, about 8-12 minutes.

Remove mixture from heat and stir in the lemon juice. Cool mixture slightly
until skins forms on top, about 20 minutes. Strain though a fine mesh sieve.
Discard zest. Divide the mixture into 6 individual glasses, jars or ramekins.

Refrigerate uncovered for 3 hours until set. Once mixture has chilled for 3
hours each portion can be covered with plastic wrap in refrigerator for up to
2 days. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish
with fresh berries
