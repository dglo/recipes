Welsh Rarebit

2 Tbs. butter
1 shallot, sliced thin
1 cup grated cheddar
1/3 cup ale or lager
1 tsp. mustard
pinch of salt
2 eggs, lightly beaten
4 slices of bread, your choice
black pepper

Melt the butter in a saucepan, then add the shallot until it has softened. Add
the cheddar, ale, mustard, and salt. Stir over low heat until the cheese has
just melted. Add the eggs and stir until the mixture has slightly thickened,
around 2 minutes. Be sure to not overcook, or you'll end up with scrambled eggs!

Toast the bread, then spoon the cheesy mixture over the top of the toast. Cook
under a hot broiler until the top is puffy and golden. Sprinkle generously
with black pepper, and serve.
