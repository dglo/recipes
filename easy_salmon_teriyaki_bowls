Total: 15 mins
Serves 4

4 salmon fillets, about 5 ounces (140 g) each
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable or canola oil
4 cups cooked white or brown rice (about 680 g cooked rice)
1 avocado, diced
1 Persian or Japanese cucumber, diced
6 to 8 scallions, thinly sliced
1/2 cup (120 ml) homemade or store-bought teriyaki sauce (see below)
Furikake and/or toasted sesame seeds, for serving (see notes)

Press salmon fillets between paper towels to dry surfaces thoroughly. Season
on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large stainless steel skillet
over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add salmon fillets, skin side down.
Immediately reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, pressing gently on back of fillets
to ensure good contact between the skin and the pan, until skin is rendered and
crisp, about 6 minutes. If skin shows resistance when you attempt to lift with
a spatula, allow it to continue to cook until it lifts easily.

Flip salmon and cook on second side until a thermometer inserted into the
thickest part registers 120F (49C) for medium-rare or 130F (54C) for medium,
about 1 minute longer. Transfer salmon to a paper towelâ€“lined plate to drain.

Divide rice evenly between 4 serving bowls. Top with diced avocado, cucumber,
and scallions. Top each with a salmon fillet and spoon sauce on top, using the
back of a spoon to evenly glaze each fillet. Sprinkle with furikake and/or
sesame seeds. Serve immediately.
