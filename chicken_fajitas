1-1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt
1-1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
1-1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, optional
1-1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into thin strips

1/2 medium green pepper, julienned
4 green onions, thinly sliced
