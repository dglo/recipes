Recipe:  Summer Chicken Pot Pie

1 carrot, diced very small
1 celery, diced very small
1 small shallot, diced very small
1 garlic clove, minced
3 tablespoons tarragon, torn into pieces
1/4 lb green beans, cut into small pieces
1 small yellow summer squash, cut into small pieces
1 russet potato, small dice
1 large pre-cooked chicken breast, cut into small pieces
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons flour
2 cups chicken broth
salt and pepper to taste
puff pastry, cut to fit your baking dishes
1 egg
1 tablespoon water

Heat oven to 400.  Butter two large ramekins or 4 smaller ones.  In a large
dutch oven, drizzle a small amount of  olive oil; heat over medium heat.  Add
the shallots, stir, and cook until soft;  about 3 minutes.  Add the carrots
and celery, stir, and cook for another 5 minutes.  Add the green beans, summer
squash and russet potato;  stir and cook for 5 minutes.  Add the garlic and
tarragon, stir, and cook for 1 minute.  Turn off the heat and set aside.  In a
small saucepan, add the olive oil and butter, heat over medium heat until the
butter is melted.  Whisk in the flour, and continue cooking until slightly
bubbly;  about a minute.  Add the chicken broth, whisk until smooth, and cook
over low heat until thick;  about 3 – 5 minutes.  Season with salt and pepper
to taste.  Pour the sauce over the vegetable mixture, and gently stir in the
chicken.  Pour the mixture into the buttered ramekins.  Cover the tops of the
ramekins with puff pastry that has been cut slightly larger than the top of
the dish.  Lightly crimp the sides of the puff pastry over the sides of the
dish.  Beat the egg with a tablespoon of water, and gently brush the tops of
the puff pastry.  Put the ramekins onto a baking sheet, and slide into the
oven.  Bake until the tops are golden, and the inside is bubbly, it will begin
to come out the sides;  will take approximately 25 – 35 minutes.
