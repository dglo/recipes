Rich Chicken Stew

Makes 8 servings, generous 3/4 cup each
Ingredients
1 pound mushrooms, stems trimmed, caps wiped clean
1/2 cup finely chopped shallots (2 large)
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 cup water, divided
4 cups reduced-sodium chicken broth 
1 cup thinly sliced carrots (1 large)
1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried 
2 bay leaves
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut in 2-inch chunks 
2 1/4-inch-thick lemon slices (including peel), seeded
1/2 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest
2 tablespoons cornstarch 
1/4 cup whipping cream
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/2 teaspoon salt 
Freshly ground pepper to taste
1 1/2 cups frozen green peas, rinsed under cold water to thaw 
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley

Combine mushrooms, shallots, oil and 1/4 cup water in a 5- to 6-quart Dutch
oven. Cover and cook over high heat, stirring often, until mushrooms are
juicy, 3 to 4 minutes. Uncover and cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms
are lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add broth, carrots, thyme and bay
leaves; bring to a boil.

Place chicken in a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker and lay lemon slices on top. Turn
heat to high. Carefully pour in the vegetable mixture. Cover and cook until
the chicken is very tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. 

With a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken and vegetables to a bowl; discard
bay leaves and lemon slices. Skim fat and pour the juices into a large
saucepan; add lemon zest. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil until reduced
to 2 cups, 15 to 20 minutes. 

Mix cornstarch with remaining 1/4 cup water in a small bowl. Add to the pan
and cook, stirring, until slightly thickened. Add cream and lemon juice; stir
until boiling. Return the chicken and vegetables to the sauce and heat through.
Season with salt and pepper. Just before serving, stir in peas and parsley.

Simmered Stew variation:
Total: 1 1/2 hours
In Step 1, use only 1 1/2 cups broth. In Step 2, add chicken, lemon slices and
lemon zest to the Dutch oven. Cover and simmer gently over low heat until the
chicken is very tender, about 45 minutes. Discard lemon slices and bay leaves.
Omit Step 3.
Continue with Step 4, cooking everything in the Dutch oven over medium-high
heat.

Tips
Prepare through Step 4 up to adding the peas and parsley. Cover and
refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the
refrigerator, if necessary, and reheat on the stovetop, in a microwave or in
the oven; just before serving, stir in peas and parsley.
