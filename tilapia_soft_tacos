Tilapia Soft Tacos with Chipotle Cream

4 servings

1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
4 cloves garlic, minced
3 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped
1 pound tilapia fillets
2 tablespoons lime juice
2 cups mixed greens

In a skillet set at medium-high heat, add the seven ingredients from the
olive oil through the cilantro. Saute those ingredients for 5 minutes.

Add the tilapia and cover and cook for 3 minutes or until fish is fully
cooked. Add in lime juice and let cook for 1 additional minute.

Heat the tortillas according to the package instructions. Lay each of the
warmed tortillas on a cutting board and place one-quarter of both the field
greens and fish on the center of each tortilla. Top each with equal amounts
of the Chipotle Cream Sauce.  Fold the tortillas over to form tacos and serve.
