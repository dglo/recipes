Time-to-table: 90 minutes 
Serves 8
3 cups water
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup wild rice, rinsed

1 tablespoon unsalted butter
1 onion, diced (about 11/2 cups)
4 stalks celery, diced (about 2 cups)
1 large carrot, grated (about 1 cup)
2 cups turkey stock or 141/2 ounce can chicken broth
2 cups half & half whisked with 1/4 cup flour
2 tablespoons dry sherry
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
3 cups cooked turkey, diced

1/3 cup toasted almonds
Bring water to boil in a saucepan. Stir in salt and rice, simmer for 30 - 45 minutes until the rice is tender but still chewy.
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt the butter and saute the onion, celery and carrots until soft. Add the stock or broth and bring to a boil, then slowly stir in the cream/flour mixture. Add the sherry, salt and pepper. Add the turkey and let simmer slowly while the rice finishes.
Gently stir rice into the turkey mixture. Transfer to two-quart greased casserole dish. (See ALANNAs TIPS.) Top with almonds and bake for 35  40 minutes at 375F.
