Prep: 12 min
Inactive: 20 min
Cook: 14 min
Yield: 12 cookies 

1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup light brown sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1 large egg, at room temperature
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2 cups old fashioned oats
1 cup dried cranberries
1 (4-ounce) 60 percent cacao bittersweet chocolate bar
   (recommended: Ghirardelli), chopped into 1/4-inch chunks

Put an oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking
soda, and salt. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the
butter and sugars together until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the egg
and vanilla and beat until smooth. With the machine running, gradually add the
flour mixture. Add the oats, cranberries and chocolate chunks. Mix until just
incorporated (dough will be stiff). Using a 4-ounce cookie scoop, scoop
slightly rounded mounds of the dough into 12 (2-inch-diameter) balls. Arrange
6 balls of dough, spaced evenly apart, on each baking sheet. Using the back of
a spoon, flatten the tops slightly and bake until the cookies are slightly
golden on the edges, about 13 to 15 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the
baking sheet for 20 minutes before serving.
