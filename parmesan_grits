3 tablespoons unsalted butter
Kosher salt
1 cup stone-ground grits
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup low-fat milk
3/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (3 ounces)
Freshly ground pepper

In a medium saucepan, bring 3 1/2 cups of water to a boil with 1 tablespoon
of the butter. Add a generous pinch of salt and gradually whisk in the
grits. Cook over moderately low heat, whisking often, until the grits are
thick and just tender, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in another medium saucepan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of
butter. Whisk in the flour, and when it is bubbling, gradually whisk in the
milk. Cook over moderate heat, whisking frequently, until thickened and no fl
oury taste remains, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the grated cheese and cook
until just melted, about 2 minutes.

Using a rubber spatula, fold the Parmesan sauce into the grits and season
with salt and pepper. Serve right away.
