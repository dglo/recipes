Mexican Wedding Cookies
2 1/2 dozen cookies

1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, plus more for coating baked cookies
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting hands
1 cup pecans, toasted, chopped into very small pieces

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line cookies sheets with parchment paper.

Toast pecans in oven for 8-10 minutes.

Using an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar at low speed until it is
smooth. Beat in the vanilla. At low speed gradually add the flour. Mix in the
pecans with a spatula. With floured hands, take out about 1 tablespoon of
dough and shape into a crescent. Continue to dust hands with flour as you make
more cookies. Place onto prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 16 minutes.

When cool enough to handle but still warm, roll in 1.5 cups confectioners'
sugar mixed with 1/8 tsp cinnamon.  Cool on wire racks.
