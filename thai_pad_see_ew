BASIC PAD SEE EW      

This basic version of a popular Thai noodle dish uses only a few ingredients
and takes less than 20 minutes to prepare.  You can add broccoli and tofu, if
desired.

Prep time: 10 MINS   Cook time:  10 MINS
Serves: 2

1 clove garlic, minced
3 tsp. palm sugar
3 Tbsp. light soy sauce
2 Tbsp. vegetable oil
1 small shallot, thinly sliced
12 oz/ 340 g fresh, wide rice noodles (about 2 cups packed)
20 leaves fresh basil

Whisk together garlic, sugar and soy sauce in a small bowl. Set aside. Heat
oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add shallot and cook just until it begins
to soften, approximately 30 seconds. Add prepared sauce, heating until sauce
begins to boil (if the wok is hot enough this should happen almost
immediately). Add noodles and basil, stirring vigorously to coat in sauce.
When basil begins to wilt and noodles have begun to brown on the bottom of the
wok, 2-3 minutes, remove wok from heat. Serve immediately.

Dry rice noodles (often labeled "rice stick noodles") can be substituted for
fresh noodles. Replace the 12 oz of fresh noodles with 6 oz (170 g) dry rice
noodles. Boil the dry noodles in water just until they become tender. Rinse
and drain the noodles well before continuing with the recipe.
