Pasta Pomodoro

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 minced sweet onion
5 minced garlic cloves
pinch crushed red pepper flakes
28 ounces peeled tomatoes, pureed
Heavy hand of salt
5 fresh basil leaves
12 ounces angel hair pasta
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan

Heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat and cook the onion until soft,
about 7 minutes.  Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes.

Add the crushed red pepper, and the tomato puree.  Season lightly with salt.
Cook for 25 minutes on medium low heat.

Add the basil leaves whole so that you can remove them later.  Heat 3 quarts
of water and season heavily with salt.  Cook the pasta 2 minutes shorter than
the package says.  Keep 1 cup of pasta cooking water.

Discard the basil, and add 1/2 cup of the water, or more if needed.  Drain the
pasta and add to the sauce to finish cooking.  Add the butter and parmesan to
finish.
