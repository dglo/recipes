2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
2 teaspoons cream of tartar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon coarse salt
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
1 3/4 cups sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons cinnamon
Dash of black pepper
Dash of ground red pepper

Preheat oven to 400 degrees, with racks in upper and lower thirds. In a
medium bowl, sift together flour, cocoa powder, cream of tartar, baking soda,
and salt. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat butter and 1 1/2 cups
sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down 
side of bowl. Add eggs and beat to combine. With mixer on low, gradually add 
flour mixture and beat until combined.

In a small bowl, combine remaining 1/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, and peppers. Using
heaping tablespoons, form balls of dough and roll in cinnamon-sugar mixture.
Place, about 3 inches apart, on two parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake until
cookies are set in center and begin to crack, about 10 minutes, rotating
sheets halfway through. Let cookies cool on sheets on wire racks 5 minutes,
then transfer cookies to racks to cool completely. (Store in an airtight
container, up to 1 week.)
