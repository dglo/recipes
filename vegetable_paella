Vegetable Paella
Serves 6, adapted from The Fannie Farmer Cookbook

2 tbsp olive oil
2 onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 lb tomatoes, chopped
6 medium artichoke hearts, sliced
2 red bell peppers, sliced
2 cups green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
1 cup peas
5 1/2 cups veggie broth
zest of 1 lemon, cut into strips
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1/2 tsp turmeric
pinch saffron
1/4 cup parsley, minced
salt to taste
1 lb arborio rice

In a large, wide flat-bottomed pan or paella pan (or pot), heat the oil on
medium-high.  Add in the onions and garlic and cook until the onions are soft,
about 5 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes.

Add the artichokes, peppers, string beans, peas, and 2 cups of the veggie
broth.  Cover and simmer for 10 minutes.

Add the lemon zest, paprika, turmeric, saffron, parsley, salt, rice and the
remainder of the veggie broth.  Mix well.  Bring to a boil, then cover and
simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the rice is done
and the liquid has evaporated.
