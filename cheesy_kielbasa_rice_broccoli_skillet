Prep time: 5 mins
Cook time: 25 mins
Serves: 6 servings

1/2 tbsp olive oil
1 Polska Kielbasa, sliced on a diagonal
1 small onion, diced
1 small bell pepper, diced
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup white rice
2 cups chicken stock or broth
2 cups broccoli florets - bite size pieces
2 cups shredded cheese, divided ) I used a cheddar blend)

Heat olive oil over medium high heat in a large, lidded skillet.

Brown kielbasa in the skillet, 3-4 minutes on each side. Remove with a slotted
spoon.

Saute onion and bell pepper until onion is translucent. Make sure to work the
brown bits off the bottom of the skillet - more flavor :)

Add rice to the skillet and stir to combine. Continue stirring for 1 to 2 more
minutes.

Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook
for 15 minutes.

Without disturbing the rice, add the broccoli to the top of the rice and cover
again. Cook an additional 5 to 7 minutes or until rice is tender.

Stir in kielbasa, broccoli and 1 cup of cheese.

Top with remaining cup of cheese. Cover with lid and let sit for 2 to 3 minutes
or until cheese is melted.
