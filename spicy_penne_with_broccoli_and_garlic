Prep time 5 mins
Cook time 10 mins
Total time 15 mins
Serves: 4

1/2 box (13-14 oz) of whole wheat penne pasta (any pasta will work)
1 pound of fresh broccoli, cleaned and chopped into florets
1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
1/2 tbsp. butter
2 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
1 tsp. crushed red pepper flake (more or less depending on your spice preference)
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese.
Sea salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste.

Begin to cook pasta to "al-dente" according to package instructions. A couple
of minutes before pasta should be done, add the broccoli to the pot. When the
time is up for the pasta, drain the pasta and broccoli, reserving one cup of
starchy pasta water. Put pasta and broccoli back into hot pot. Set aside.

While pasta is cooking, heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive
and butter once the pan is hot.

When butter is melted, add the garlic and red pepper flake. Saute the spice
for 2 minutes, being careful not to burn.

Once the garlic has turned light brown, pour the sauce over the pasta and
broccoli. Add the reserved starchy cooking water, parmesan, salt and pepper.
Toss to combine.

Serve hot, room temperature or even cold.
