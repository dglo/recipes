Put rice and water into cooker according to directions, except substitute
lentils for about a third of the rice. Break off some chunks of a cauliflower
and throw them in. Cut some small potatoes into chunks and put those in too.
Like carrots? Peas? Wheat berries? Cloves? Hot peppers? Onions? Green beans?
Put some of those in too. Works great with frozen veg, or even frozen boneless
chicken - just toss it in there, no need to thaw. Push the COOK button and go
take a bath. In half an hour, it has cooked itself. Eat plain or with yogurt,
hot sauce, chutney, whatever. One of these is two meals for me; I don't bother
to make bigger batches because it's so easy and lazy to make it fresh.
