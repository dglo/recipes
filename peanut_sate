This is my take on Noodles & Company's Indonesian Peanut Saute. I love that
it's really versatile in that whatever veggies you have in the fridge you can
throw in and it comes together quickly!

Sauce:
2 tablespoons peanut butter
1/3 cup veggie broth (or water)
1/4-1 teaspoon red chiles, crushed
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon ginger, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
2 tablespoons tamari (soy sauce)
Everything Else:
4 oz brown rice noodles
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 medium onion
4 cups assorted veggies (cauliflower, carrots, broccoli, and/or spinach.)

Toppings:
Bean Sprouts
Cilantro
Lime juice

In a bowl, whisk together ingredients for sauce, tasting and adding more of
anything you may want. If you like it mild, add less red chiles (1/4 teaspoon)
and if you like it hot, add more! Set aside.

In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add in onion and cook
until onion is fragrant and translucent, 4-5 minutes. Stir in choice of
veggies (except spinach) and cook for two more minutes. Next, add in peanut
sauce and reduce temperature to low. Cover and let cook until veggies are
tender, 6-8 minutes.

Cook brown rice noodles according to package while veggies are cooking.

Add drained rice noodles to the veggie mixture along with the spinach if using.

Serve with bean sprouts, cilantro, and lime juice.
