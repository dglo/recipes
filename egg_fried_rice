Prep Time: 15 minutes
Cook Time: 10 minutes
Total Time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

5 cups cooked rice
5 large eggs (divided)
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
3 tablespoons oil (divided)
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 scallions, chopped

Use a fork to fluff up the rice and break it apart. If you're using freshly
cooked rice, let it stand on the counter uncovered until it stops steaming
before fluffing it. If you decide to refrigerate the rice overnight in advance
of preparing this recipe, it will clump up; you can then use your hands to
break up the cold rice clumps into individual grains.

Beat 3 eggs in one bowl. Beat the other 2 eggs in another bowl, along with
2 tablespoons water, the paprika, and the turmeric. Set these two bowls aside.

Heat a wok over medium high heat, and add 2 tablespoons oil. Add the 3 beaten
eggs (without the spices), and scramble them. Remove them from the wok and set
aside.

Heat wok over high heat, and add the last tablespoon oil. Add the diced onion
and bell pepper. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes. Next, add the rice and stir-fry for
2 minutes, using a scooping motion to heat the rice uniformly. Use your wok
spatula to flatten out and break up any rice clumps. Next, pour the uncooked
egg and spice mixture over the rice, and stir-fry for about 1 minute, until
all of the rice grains are coated in egg.

Add the peas and stir fry continuously for another minute. Next spread the
salt, sugar, and black pepper over the rice and mix. You should now see some
steam coming off the rice, which means it is heated through.

If the rice looks a little dry, feel free to sprinkle in some water or chicken
stock. Adding some liquid directly to any remaining clumps of rice will also
help to break them up. Mix in the scrambled eggs and scallions and serve!
