Spicy Sweet Potato Fries (4 servings)

2 medium sized sweet potatoes (each sweet potato should yield 2 servings),
               cut into matchsticks
2 egg whites
1/2 tsp each of paprika, cumin, chili powder and black pepper
1/4 tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder and salt
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper and cinnamon*

* omit the cayenne pepper if you don't like spicy foods or are making for children.

Preheat oven to 425F.

Peel and cut sweet potatoes into desired size. I like to cut mine into thick
matchsticks, or the classic french fry shape. Place fries in a large bowl.

Combine all the spices, salt and pepper in a bowl.

Whisk the two egg whites together and pour over the sweet potatoes. Using your
hands to mix around making sure all the potatoes are evenly coated.

Pour the spice mixture over top of the sweet potatoes and toss to evenly
distribute flavors.

On a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, bake sweet potatoes for 20-25
minutes or until fully cooked.
