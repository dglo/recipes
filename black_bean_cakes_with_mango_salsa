Combine all the mango salsa ingredients in a bowl. Set aside

For the bean cakes, place beans in a large bowl and coarsely mash until they
stick together. Add cilantro, onion, egg white, cumin, garlic, allspice and
cayenne. Mix until well blended.

Divide bean mixture into 8 equal parts. Shape into 1/2-inch thick patties.
Coat patties with bread crumbs. Spray both sides with nonstick cooking spray.

Heat oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Add bean cakes and fry until
golden brown on both sides, turning once, about 8 minutes total. Serve warm
with mango salsa. Garnish with cilantro and lime wedges, if desired.
