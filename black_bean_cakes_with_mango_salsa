Servings: 4

1 1/2 cups chopped onions
3 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
2 Tbs. olive oil
1 Tbs. grated fresh ginger
1 tsp. fresh thyme or 1/2 tsp. dried
1/2 tsp. ground allspice
4 1/2 cups drained, cooked black beans
3/4 cup orange juice

Saute onions and garlic in oil for about 5 minutes, until onions begin to
soften. Add ginger, thyme and allspice, and saute, stirring often to prevent
sticking, until onions are very soft, for about 5 minutes.

Stir in beans and orange juice, and cook over low heat for about 15 minutes,
stirring occasionally, until mixture thickens slightly. Use heat diffuser or
double boiler, if necessary, to prevent scorching. Mash a few beans with back
of spoon for thicker consistency. Add salt and pepper, and serve with salsa.

Mango Salsa

2 medium-sized ripe mangoes
1 small cucumber, peeled, seeded and diced
1 ripe tomato, chopped
1/2 to 1 small fresh chile, minced, or hot pepper sauce to taste
1 Tbs. chopped fresh coriander, optional

Peel and chop mangoes. In large bowl, mix together mangoes, cucumber, tomato,
lime juice, salt, chile or hot pepper sauce and fresh coriander, if using.

Let salsa sit for 10 minutes to allow flavors to blend before topping beans.
