Serves: 8

2 tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into 1/2" pieces, plus more for baking dish
8 slices bacon
1 large onion, finely chopped
4 stalks celery, finely chopped
kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1/2 c. medium-bodied beer, such as IPA
10 c. torn challah, dried overnight (from 1 lb. loaf)
1 tsp. fresh thyme leaves
8 oz. sharp white cheddar, grated
2 large eggs
1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
3 c. low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 3-quart baking dish and set aside.

In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.
Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool, then break into bite-size
pieces. Add onion and celery to skillet and season with 1/2 teaspoon each salt
and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until vegetables are soft, 6 to 8 minutes.
Add beer and simmer, scraping up any brown bits, until almost evaporated, about
2 minutes. Scrape vegetable mixture into a large bowl. Add challah, thyme,
2/3 of cheddar and 1/2 of bacon; toss to combine.

In a separate medium bowl, whisk together eggs, Worcestershire, and 2 cups
broth. Pour over challah mixture and toss until evenly moistened, adding more
broth 1/4 cup at a time until croissant pieces seem hydrated (you might not use
it all).

Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish and dot top with butter. Scatter with
remaining bacon and sprinkle with remaining cheddar. Cover dish with foil and
bake until a knife inserted in the center of the stuffing comes out warm, 30
to 35 minutes. Increase heat to 425 degrees F and continue to bake until top
is deeply golden, 10 to 15 minutes more. Let rest 10 minutes before serving.
