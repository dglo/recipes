Crust:
1/2 cup butter, room temperature
1/4 cup sugar
1 cup flour

Filling:
2 eggs
3/4 cup sugar
1/4 tsp baking powder
2 Tbsp flour
2 tsp grapefruit zest
1/2 cup grapefruit juice (approximately 1/2 a grapefruit; add up to 1/4
                          cup more juice for a more tart taste)
Pink food coloring

CRUST: Preheat oven to 350F. In a stand mixer combine ingredients until
crumbly. Press on the bottom of a 9x9 baking dish. Bake 15 minutes or until
starting to brown lightly.

FILLING: Prepare filling when crust is just about done: Using the whisk
attachment of your stand mixer, whisk the eggs, sugar, baking powder, & flour
until light & fluffy. Then add grapefruit juice with zest, & about 3 drops of
pink food coloring (or more till desired color) until combined.

Pour filling over hot crust & bake an additional 20 minutes or until edges are
golden. Let cool in the refrigerator. Cut squares, dust tops with powdered
sugar & serve. Amazing when eaten cold from the fridge.
