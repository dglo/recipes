Jacket Potatoes

2 large baking potatoes
1 tsp olive oil

Heat oven to 425 degrees.  Cut a 1/2" deep cross in the top of the potato,
then rub 1/2 tsp of olive oil on each potato and bake on top shelf of oven
for 20 minutes.

Reduce heat to 400 degrees.  Cut the cross in each potato a bit deeper to
further expose the flesh, and continue baking for 45-60 minutes until
potato skin is crisp.
