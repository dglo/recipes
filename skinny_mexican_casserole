Prep Time 20 minutes
Cook Time 30 minutes
Yield 8 servings

1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, diced
1 red bell pepper, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup corn kernels, frozen, canned or roasted
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 (4.5-ounce) can chopped green chiles, drained
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves
4 (8-inch) whole wheat tortillas, chopped
1 (16-ounce) can fat free refried beans, warmed
1 (10-ounce) can mild enchilada sauce
1 1/2 cups reduced fat shredded Mexican blend cheese

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly coat a 9x13 baking dish with nonstick
spray.

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic, onion and
bell peppers. Cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 3-4 minutes. Stir
in black beans, corn, chili powder and cumin until heated through, about 1-2
minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Stir in green chiles and
cilantro; set aside.

Place tortillas evenly on the bottom of the baking dish. Spread refried beans
evenly over the tortillas, followed by the onion mixture and enchilada sauce.
Sprinkle with cheese.

Place into oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until bubbly.

Serve immediately, garnished with cilantro, if desired.
