from Something for Everyone by Carol Gelles

Crepes
1 1/3 c milk
1 c plus 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
2 lg eggs
3 Tbsp melted butter or margarine
1 tsp salt

Place all ingredients into ablender or food processor.  Cover and process
until smooth.  Let rest 30 minutes.

Heat a 10-inch slope-sided skillet over medium heat, until a drop of water
dances across the surface before evaporating.  Brush the skillet lightly with
oil or butter.  Pour 1/4 cup batter into the skillet and immediately tilt and
rotate the pan, so that a thin layer of batter spreads over the bottom.  Cook
until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and shiny, and the bottom is
lightly browned, about 30 seconds.  Gently turn the crepe and cook the other
side a few seoncs until lightly browned.  Remove the crepe from the skillet
and place on wax paper to cool.  Repeat until all the crepe batter is used,
making 12 crepes.  Stack the crepes with wax paper between each layer.
