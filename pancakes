America's Test Kitchen Pancakes

2 cups all-purpose flour
2 T sugar
2 t baking powder
1/2 t baking soda
1/2 t salt
1 large egg
2 cups buttermilk (2 cups milk, 2 T lemon juiceâ€“let sit for 10 minutes)
3 T unsalted butter, melted and cooled

Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 200 degrees.
Set a wire cooling rack over a baking sheet and set aside.

Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a
large bowl.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, melted butter, and
then the buttermilk.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, pour
the buttermilk mixture into the well, and whisk very gently until the
buttermilk mixture is just incorporated (a few lunmps should remain).  Be
careful not to over mix the batter.

Heat a 12" nonstick skillet over medium heat for 3-5 minutes.  Brush the pan
bottom with 1 tsp oil.  Using 1/4 cup of batter per pancake, add the batter
to the skillet (only 2-3 pancakes will fit at a time) and cook until large
bubbles begin to appear, about 2 minutes.  Flip the pancakes and cook until
golden brown on the second side, about a minute and a half longer.  Spread
the pancakes out over the wire rack on the baking sheet (they shouldn't
overlap) and hold in the warm oven.  Repeat with the remaining batter,
brushing the skillet with oil as needed between batches.
