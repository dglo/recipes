Double Chocolate Stout Brownies

1 C all purpose flour
2/3 C good quality cocoa powder
1 Tbsp BLACK cocoa powder (if you don't have any, just omit)
1/4 tsp salt
6 Tbsp unsalted butter
8 oz. bittersweet chocolate
3/4 C chocolate chips (I used 1/4 C white chocolate and 1/2 C dark chocolate.
                       I would suggest NOT using milk chocolate.)
1 rounded tsp instant espresso powder
4 large eggs at room temperature
1 C white sugar
1 1/4 C Double Chocolate Stout Beer (I’m sure Guinness will do)

Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F. Line a 9"x13" baking pan with parchment
paper. Make sure two of the sides are sticking out over the pan so you can
easily remove your brownies later.

Mix together the flour, cocoa powders and salt.

Melt the butter, bittersweet chocolate, chocolate chips and espresso powder
over very low heat, stirring constantly. Use a double boiler if you have one.
Remove from the heat.

In another bowl (Sorry for the amount of dishes!), beet the eggs and sugar on
high speed until light and fluffy, at least 3 minutes. Add in the melted
chocolate mixture and beat until combined.

Fold in the flour mixture. Once it's just combined, whisk in the stout beer,
by hand. Your batter might seem a bit runny for a brownie but don't worry. It
bakes up perfectly.

Pour into your parchment lined pan and bake for 20-25 minutes. When inserting
a toothpick it should still have a few crumbs when removed from the brownies.
If it doesn't – you've overbaked your brownies and they won't be fudgy; they
will be more like cake. It's best to underbake these slightly so they are more
moist.

Let the brownies cool to room temperature on a wire cooling rack then lift out
of the pan.
