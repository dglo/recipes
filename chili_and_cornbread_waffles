Prep time:  10 mins
Cook time:  20 mins
Serves: 4
 
3/4 cup buttermilk
1/3 cup whole wheat flour
1/3 cup all purpose flour
1/3 cup cornmeal
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
2 tablespoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon oil
2-3 cups leftover chili (I used posole)
4 eggs

Mix flours, cornmeal, baking soda, baking powder, sugar and salt in a mixing
bowl. Add egg, buttermilk, and oil and whisk until just combined. If batter
seems too thick, add a tablespoon or more of buttermilk.

Heat a waffle iron and pour batter onto hot griddles. Cook until waffles are
lightly crispy and golden brown on the outside. Keep in a warm oven until
ready to serve.

Warm up chili on the stovetop. While chili is heating up, place a frying pan
over medium heat. Crack 1-2 eggs at a time into the pan (depending on the size
of your pan), keeping them separate. Allow to fry for 3-4 minutes or until the
surface of the egg whites are cooked through. The middle should still be runny.
I didn't flip my eggs because they were cooked through already and I didn't
want to break the yolks, but you could flip and cook on the other side if
you're good at frying eggs. :)

Stack waffles on a plate and top with a scoop of chili and a fried egg.
