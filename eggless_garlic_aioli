Makes: 3/4 cup

1 teaspoon salt
4 cloves garlic
1/2 tbsp lemon juice (about 1/4 of a lemon)

Crush garlic and salt using a food processor or a mortar and pestal until you
have a fine paste. Transfer garlic mixture to a nonreactive bowl. Drizzle in
1/4 cup of the oil, whisking to make an emulsion. Whisk in lemon juice then
