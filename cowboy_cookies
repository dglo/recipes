Cowboy Cookies

1 c. shortening
1 c. white sugar, granulated
1 c. brown sugar
2 eggs
2 c. all-purpose flour
1 tsp. cinnamon, ground
1/2 tsp. ancho chile, ground
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1 c. steel cut oats
1 c. coconut, shredded, sweetened
3/4 c. pecans
3/4 c. milk chocolate chips
3/4 c. butterscotch chips
1/4 c. wheat germ

Preheat oven to 350. degrees

In a large bowl, cream sugars and shortening together. Add eggs and beat until
just incorporated.

Beat in flour, cinnamon, ancho, baking soda, baking powder and salt until
dough is uniform and smooth.

Fold in oats, coconut, pecans, chips and wheat germ.

Pull off a tablespoon-sized chunk of dough and roll it between your palms into
a ball approximately 1 1/2″ around. Place dough ball on a parchment-lined
baking sheet and repeat until tray is full. These cookies spread quite a bit
while baking so you will not want to crowd your baking sheet – I only baked 8
cookies at a time on my standard size baking sheets.

Bake for approximately 12 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are just
beginning to turn a light golden brown.

YIELD:  approximately 26 cookies
