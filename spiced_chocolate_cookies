Spiced Chocolate Christmas Cookies (makes about 30 cookies)

1 1/2 cups flour
3/4 cup coco powder (not hot chocolate powder, real coco powder)
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp ginger
1/2 tsp paprika (or cayenne if you prefer)
pinch of salt
pinch of black pepper (about 1/2 tsp)
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 sticks of butter
1 tsp espresso coffee (or vanilla extract)
1 egg
 
Make sure the butter is at room temperature, then add the sugar and mix until
fluffy, then mix in the egg and the espresso

Sift together the flour, coco, cinnamon, ginger, paprika, salt and pepper in a
bowl, then add the dry mixture tbsp. by tbsp. into the butter mixture until
combined

Divide the dough in half so that it is easier to manage, then roll each lump
into a fat sausage. Wrap the logs of dough in wax paper, then freeze for at
least 2 hours, or up to a month or so

Pre heat the oven to 375f

Slice the dough into fat cookies. Place on a cold baking sheet lined with
parchment and bake for 8-10 mins - keep an eye on them. It's hard to tell if
they are burning because the dough is so dark. Plus, they firm up when they
cool.

Cool on a rack, and eat warm with ice cream as dessert, or anytime with a cup
of coffee
