Total Time: 50 min
Prep: 15 min
Cook: 20 min
Yield: 4 to 6 servings

2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pound London broil steak
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion, chopped
1/2 pound white mushrooms, sliced
1 clove garlic, minced
4 cups beef broth
1/4 cup jarred sliced pickled jalapenos
1 cup crushed canned tomatoes
1 (11-ounce bag) bag baby spinach
1/2 cup sour cream
3 cups tortilla chips, crumbled

Preheat a grill to medium-high. In a small bowl, combine cumin, garlic powder,
thyme, salt, and pepper. Rub the spice blend over all of the steak pieces
along with 1 tablespoon of the oil. Let rest at room temperature, about 15
minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large pot, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and heat
over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until tender, about 4 minutes. Stir
in the mushrooms and garlic and saute until mushrooms are tender, adding extra
oil if needed. Pour in the broth, jalapenos and crushed tomatoes. Bring to a
boil then reduce heat and simmer while beef cooks.

On a hot grill sear steak until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes
per side. Remove from grill to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Cut
beef into strips and stir into soup, along with spinach. Season soup, to
taste. Transfer to serving bowls and top with a dollop of sour cream and
tortilla chips.
