Servings: 12 to 16
Time: 1 hour

CRUMBS
10 tablespoons (140 grams) unsalted butter, melted
1/2 cup (110 grams) dark brown sugar
1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar
1 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 2/3 cups (215 grams) all-purpose flour

CAKE
6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter, softened
1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
1 large egg
1/2 cup (120 grams) sour cream
2 tablespoons (30ml) water or milk
1 teaspoon (5ml) vanilla extract
1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
Powdered sugar, for dusting

Heat oven: To 350°F (175°C). Lightly coat an 8-inch square or 9-inch cake pan
with butter or nonstick spray. For extra security, line it with parchment paper.

Make crumbs: Whisk butter, sugars, cinnamon, and salt together until evenly
mixed. Add flour and mix until it disappears. It’s going to be very thick;
press it evenly into the bottom of the bowl and set it aside.

Make cake: Beat butter with sugar until lightened and fluffy. Add egg, water
or milk, sour cream, and vanilla and beat until combined. Sprinkle surface of
batter with baking powder and salt, and beat well to combine. Add flour and
mix only until it disappears.

Assemble: Scrape batter into prepared cake pan and smooth it flat. Use a spoon
to loosen the crumbs from the bottom of the bowl where they’ve rested, breaking
them up into big and small rubble. Sprinkle evenly over the batter.

Bake: Bake for about 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the
cake just below the crumbs comes out batter-free. Check in a few spots, in case
it has baked unevenly.

Cool to lukewarm, if you can bear it, before dusting it generously with
powdered sugar and cutting the cake into squares or wedges.

Do ahead: This cake keeps in an airtight container at room temperature for 3
to 4 days, but I like it best in the first two.
