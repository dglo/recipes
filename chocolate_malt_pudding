Chocolate Malt Pudding

1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/4 cup malted milk powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 quart milk
2 egg yolks
8 ounces chocolate, chopped or broken into small pieces
1 tablespoon vanilla extract

Put the sugar, cornstarch, malted milk powder, and salt into a saucepan, Whisk
to combine. Add the milk, slowly, whisking to combine so there are no lumps or
clumps. If you're using the malted milk powder that requires heat, you'll see
grains, but you shouldn't have large lumps. Add the egg yolks and whisk to
combine.

Turn the heat on to medium high, and cook, stirring constantly, until you see
small bubbles beginning to form and the mixture begins thickening. Lower the
heat a bit, and continue cooking and stirring constantly until you have large
bubbles forming. The mixture should be thick. Turn the heat off and add the
chocolate. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and incorporated.
Add the vanilla and stir until it is combined.

Strain the mixture through a fine strainer into your preferred storage
container. If you don't like skin on top of your cooked pudding, put a layer
of plastic wrap directly on top of the pudding. If you like that skin, just
cover the container. Refrigerate until cold.
