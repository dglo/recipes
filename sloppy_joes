My Family's Favorite Sloppy Joes
45 min | 15 min prep | SERVES 4

I've tried many recipes, this is the best. I once 'dec-tupled' (10x) this
recipe to sell sandwiches at a craft fair at my church. People were waiting in
line to buy leftovers. Freezes well, goes up to the lake or camping well and
is a hit on Halloween...it's no-fail. Easy to double, triple, etc. I've been
making Joes this way for over 20 years.

1    c lentils
2    c water
2-3  stalks celery, chopped
1    small onion, chopped
1 (8     ounce) can tomato sauce
1/4  cup ketchup
1/4  cup barbecue sauce  (your favorite, we use Open Pit)
1    tablespoon firmly packed brown sugar
1    teaspoon dry mustard
salt and pepper
1    tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1    tablespoon vinegar

In a large skillet, saute celery and onion.  Add lentils and water, cover, and simmer for
15 minutes.
Stir in remaining ingredients, simmer covered, 15-20 minutes, stirring
occasionally.
If Joes appear too 'loose', leave cover off and let moisture evaporate.
Cook until it's the consistency you like for serving on toasted buns, with
french fries and cole slaw.
