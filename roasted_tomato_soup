Roasted Tomato Soup

5 large tomatoes, cut into 3/4" slices
1 onion, cut into 1/2" slices
1/2 jalapeno, cut in half lengthwise, seeded
2 bell peppers, seeded, cut into 4 pieces
olive oil
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
freshly ground black pepper
2 cups vegetable broth
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese (plus additional cheese for garnishing)
few tablespoons of heavy cream or creme fraiche (optional)

Preheat oven to 375F. Arrange all vegetables on baking sheet. Drizzle olive
oil all over. Roast for 20 minutes.

For immersion blender:
Roughly chop all vegetables. Add all vegetables, smoked paprika, garlic powder,
salt, pepper, vegetable broth and grated cheese to pot large enough so that
when you use your immersion blender, it doesn't splatter all over the place.
Blend in pot until you get a nice puree. Bring to simmer, taste and adjust
seasoning.

For standard blender:
Add all ingredients to blender, blend until smooth puree. Taste and adjust
seasoning. Pour into pot and heat to serve.

Garnish with additional parmesan cheese, a turn of the pepper mill and serve
with crusty bread.
