Cook/prep Time: 40 min

1/3 cup beluga lentils, rinsed and sorted
10 oz Yukon Gold potatoes
4 oz sugar snap peas, thinly sliced
2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
1 lemon, juiced
1 red bell pepper, trimmed and thinly sliced
2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
2 tbsp vegan butter
1 tsp smoked paprika
1/4 cup sour cream
1 jalapeno, trimmed, deseeded, and thinly sliced
1 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp vegetable oil
Salt
Pepper

Combine lentils and 1/2 cup water in small saucepan. Bring to a boil, cover,
reduce heat to low, and simmer until lentils are tender, 20 to 24 minutes.
Drain any remaining water.

TIP: To “sort” lentils (as noted in the ingredient list) means to look for and
discard any naturally occurring debris or stones.

Cover potatoes with 1 inch water in large pot and bring to a boil. Cook until
potatoes are fork-tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and let cool.

Combine snap peas, scallion, lemon juice, 1 tbsp olive oil, and a pinch of
salt in medium bowl and toss snap pea slaw.

Place cooled potatoes on clean work surface and use palm of hand to gently
press each potato until sides blister open. Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in large
nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add smashed potatoes and cook until golden
brown and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Add bell pepper, garlic, butter,
and paprika, and cook until pepper begins to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Season to
taste with salt and pepper.

Scatter cooked lentils over crispy potato skillet. Serve family-style, topped
with snap pea slaw, sour cream, and as much jalapeno as you like. Enjoy!
