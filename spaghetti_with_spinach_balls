Spaghetti and Spinach Balls

Spaghetti - 1/2 lb or half of the packet
Pasta sauce - 1 cup
Oil - 1 tbsp 

Chopped spinach - 1 cup, frozen
Garlic - 3 cloves, chopped
Ricotta cheese - 1/4 cup
Bread crumbs - 1/2 cup
Oil - 1 tsp + 2 tbsp
Salt and pepper - to taste

Boil the spaghetti as per box instruction. Heat a pan with a tsp of oil, add
garlic and paprika flakes. Add the spinach. Let it cook in a medium flame till
all water are absorbed. If the spinach is cooked and you have more water,
remove the water and use it later. 

Switch off the flame. After it cools completely, add the ricotta cheese,
bread crumbs and salt. Mix well.

Make balls from the mixture. Heat a small pan with 2 tbsp of oil and shallow
fry the balls, turning around to make golden and crispier. Remove and place
them aside. Heat the wide pan with a tbsp of oil, add paprika flakes.

Add pasta sauce and boil for 2 minutes. Add the spinach balls and spaghetti.
Stir gently.

Serve immediately.

Notes:
If you want to use fresh spinach, wash and drain the water completely and
proceed in the same way.
Ricotta cheese can be replaced by panner. 
If your spinach mixture is too dry to form a ball, add a tbsp of cheese. If
it's too moist, try adding more bread crumbs.
If you are not comfortable in handling spinach balls with sauce, stir 
spaghetti and sauce first. While serving you can add the spinach ball.
