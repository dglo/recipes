Slow-Roasted Vegetable Soup

6 plum tomatoes
2 large red bell peppers
2 small sweet potatoes
3 garlic cloves
Salt and freshly ground pepper
Butter, room temperature (enough to coat the oven dish)
Olive oil
1/2 cup heavy cream
1 cup basil leaves
Broth/water
paprika

Preheat oven to 325F. Prepare the tomatoes by removing the skin: remove the
core to all the tomatoes and make two perpendicular incisions on top of the
tomatoes. Once the water boils, put the tomatoes in and cook for 30 seconds
max. Immediately place in cold water with ice. Once the tomatoes are cool to
touch, peel the skin and chop into quarters, length-wise.

Remove seeds and membranes to red bell peppers and slice into strips. Rub an
ovenproof dish with butter. Place bell peppers and tomatoes in dish. Season
liberally with salt and pepper. Scatter the basil leaves over the bell peppers
and tomatoes. Drizzle with olive oil, and then place in oven. Wash the sweet
potatoes and wrap them in foil, put those in the oven too. Bake for 2 hours.

Remove vegetables from oven. Drain the tomatoes and bell peppers, set aside.
Unwrap the sweet potatoes and peel the skin. Chop the sweet potatoes roughly
and place in a pot. Chop the tomatoes and bell peppers and put those with the
sweet potatoes. Add some broth (if available) or water to cover the vegetables.
Once boiling, blend until smooth, then add heavy cream on low heat.

Serve immediately with toasted baguette slices and a salad.
