Prep: 15 m
Cook: 35 m

4 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 cups chopped onions
1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced
2 teaspoons dried dill weed
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup milk
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
ground black pepper to taste
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup sour cream

Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Saute the onions in the
butter for 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and saute for 5 more minutes. Stir in
the dill, paprika, soy sauce and broth. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer
for 15 minutes.

In a separate small bowl, whisk the milk and flour together. Pour this into
the soup and stir well to blend. Cover and simmer for 15 more minutes,
stirring occasionally.

Finally, stir in the salt, ground black pepper, lemon juice, parsley and sour
cream. Mix together and allow to heat through over low heat, about 3 to 5
minutes. Do not boil. Serve immediately.
