Turkey, Cranberry and Cheddar Pocket Pies

2 Tenderflake Frozen Deep Dish Pie Shells
1/4 cup finely chopped left over turkey
2 tbsp cranberry sauce
2 tbsp grated cheddar cheese
1 tbsp milk
pepper

Preheat oven to 400 F. Remove pie shells from freezer and allow to thaw at
room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes.

Remove pie shells from foil onto a clean, flat, lightly floured work surface.
If cracks appear in the pastry, press together and repair using fingers
moistened with water. Cut out six shapes from each pie using a shaped cookie
cutter. Set any leftover dough aside.

Combine turkey, cranberry sauce, cheese and pepper in a small bowl. Divide
mixture evenly between 6 cut outs, mounding in center and leaving a 1/4"
border. Top with remaining cut outs. Gently press edges together and crimp
with a fork.

Brush tops lightly with milk and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until pastry is
golden. Allow pies to rest for 10 minutes before serving.
