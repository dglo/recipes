https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019816-vegetarian-carbonara-with-spinach

Yield: 4 servings
Time: 20 minutes


3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 cup finely chopped onion
5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
1 pound spaghetti
Salt and pepper
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 pound fresh baby spinach
Red-pepper flakes, to taste (optional)
3/4 cup grated Parmesan (2 1/2 ounces)
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
½ cup grated smoked Provolone or Gouda (1 1/2 ounces)

Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and
garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until light golden, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a pot of salted boiling water until al dente.
Reserve 2 cups cooking water and drain the pasta. Return the pasta and
reserved cooking water to the pot and heat over low. Add the butter and
onion-garlic mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until most of the liquid
is absorbed and sauce is slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the spinach,
season with salt, plenty of pepper and red-pepper flakes, if using, and stir
until spinach is wilted. Stir in the Parmesan and lemon juice; season with
salt and pepper.

Divide the pasta among 4 bowls and top each with 2 tablespoons smoked cheese.
Finish with more black pepper, if desired.
