Zesty Grilled Tilapia

6 (6-ounce) tilapia fillets
6 tablespoons olive oil, plus additional for brushing
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
3 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice
3 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon hot sauce, to taste
1 teaspoon salt
Freshly ground black pepper

Place the fish in a large nonmetal dish. Whisk together the 6 tbsp oil, orange
zest, orange juice, ginger, hot sauce, salt, and pepper, to taste; pour over
the fish. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare grill. Brush the fish with additional oil. Grill until fish
just flakes when tested with a fork, about 5 minutes per side for each inch of
thickness.

Mango Coconut Rice

1 tablespoon olive oil
1 1/2 cups long-grain rice
1 (14-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
2/3 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
1 large ripe mango, peeled and cubed

In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the rice and stir
to coat with the oil. Add the coconut milk, water, and salt; bring to a boil.
Stir in the mango. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer about 20 minutes or
until the liquid is absorbed.

Remove the rice from the heat and fluff with a fork. Place a clean, dry dish
towel over the pan, cover with the lid, and let steam for 5 minutes before
serving.
