Prep Time: 20 minutes
Cook Time: 35 minutes
Total Time: 55 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings

2 tbs. olive oil
1/2 yellow onion, diced
3/4 cup sliced baby carrots
1 cup broccoli florets
3/4 cup corn (fresh or frozen; can also uses peas if desired)
About 8 dutch gold potatoes, diced into small cubes
1/4 cup white wine (optional)
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1/3 cup unsalted butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups skim milk
1/2 vegetable broth
1 refrigerated pie dough

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In a skillet, heat the olive oil on medium heat. Cook the onions, carrots, and potatoes for about 5 minutes. Add in the broccoli, corn, and white wine and cook for another 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and garlic powder. Remove from the heat and set aside.
In a sauce pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Sprinkle in the flour and whisk together with the butter. Then whisk in the milk and broth, stirring constantly. Simmer for about 3 minutes or until the sauce has thickened.
Add the vegetables into the sauce and stir to combine. Pour the mixture into one pie plate or divide evenly amongst ramekins or small baking dishes. Roll out the pie dough. If using the pie plate, place the dough over the vegetable mixture, trim excess, and crimp around the edges. If using individual dishes, cut the dough into quarters, slightly roll each piece out to be more circular in shape. Place one piece over each dish, trim edges and crimp. Using a fork or knife, poke a few holes in the dough to allow the steam to escape. Bake for about 35 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.
