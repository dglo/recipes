Prep Time: 15 mins   Total Time: 35 mins   Yield: 6-7 patties

The cornbread gives this a Southern flair. You can use this base to make a
variety of patties. = Salmon is my favorite, but I've made them with pretty
much whatever I had on hand. Great for leftover salmon or even chicken. If you
don't have leftover cornbread and don't want to make it, you can use
breadcrumbs, or crushed crackers. You can also omit the potatoes if you don't
have any.

1 1/2 cups salmon
1/2 cup mashed potatoes
1/2 cup diced bell peppers (any color)
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1 eggs, lightly beaten
1/2 cup cornbread, crumbled (more if needed)
2 tablespoons horseradish sauce
1 tablespoon dill
1 tablespoon lemon juice (or lime)
1 tablespoon hot sauce
3 -4 tablespoons oil, to fry

Blend potatoes, mayo, horseradish sauce, hot sauce, and lemon juice together.
Add salmon, dill, egg and bell pepper. Mix gently but well.
Stir in breadcrumbs, adding more if needed to hold mixture together.
Shape into patties.
Fry each side 4-5 minutes or until browned.
great on a bun or own it's own with a salad.
