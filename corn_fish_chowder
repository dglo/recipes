Corn-Fish Chowder			(Cooking Light, July 2001, p. 166)

1 tbsp. vegetable oil
1/2 c. chopped onion
1 1/2 tsp. ground thyme
2 (15.75 oz.) cans vegetable broth
1 lb. peeled baking potato, cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices
2 c. fresh or frozen whole-kernel corn
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 tsp. black pepper
2 (8.25 oz.) cans cream-style corn
1 (12-oz) can evaporated milk
1 lb. fish, cubed (orange roughy, catfish, cod, etc.)
1/2 c. instant potato flakes (not granules)

Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add onions;
saute 5 minutes.  Stir in thyme, broth, and potato; bring
to a boil.  Reduce heat; simmer 10 minutes.

Add whole-kernel corn and next 4 ingredients (whole-kernel
corn through milk); bring to a simmer.  Stir in fish; cook
9 minutes or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork.
Add potato flakes, and cook until thick (about 1 minute);
stir constantly.  Garnish with black pepper, if desired.

Yield: 8 servings.

Note:  I couldn't find potato flakes, so I just pureed a few
cups of the solids (potatoes, corn, fish ... whatever I scooped
up) and it seemed to work just fine.
