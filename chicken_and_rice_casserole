Chicken and Rice Casserole

Prep Time: 15 minutes
Cook Time: 20 minutes
Yield: Serves 4

4 tablespoons butter, divided
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon dried leaf thyme or marjoram
1 cup chicken broth
1 cup milk
2 cups diced cooked chicken
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
salt, to taste
2 cups cooked rice
1 cup frozen peas and carrots, cooked just until tender
1/2 cup soft fine bread crumbs
1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Heat the oven to 375F. Grease a 2-quart baking dish or spray with nonstick
cooking spray.

Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add
the flour and thyme and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Gradually stir in the
chicken broth and milk, cooking and stirring until thickened and smooth. Add
the pepper, taste, and add salt, as needed. Stir in the chicken and set aside.

Spread the cooked rice in the baking dish, then sprinkle with the cooked peas
and carrots. Spoon the chicken mixture over the vegetable layer. Sprinkle the
shredded cheese over the chicken layer.

Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter and toss with the bread crumbs until
the crumbs are thoroughly coated. Sprinkle over the cheese.

Bake the casserole for 20 to 25 minutes, until hot and bubbly and lightly
browned.
