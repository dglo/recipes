Crockpot Doro Wat

1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons butter
3 large onions, diced (or 3 tablespoons dried minced onion flakes)
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and more to taste if you'd like
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
2 cups water
8 hard-boiled eggs (peeled, to add later)

Use a 6-quart slow cooker. Empty the tomato can into your cooker. Put in the
chicken thighs, and add the lemon juice. Now add butter, onion, and ALL of the
spices. Pour in the water. Cover and cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, or high for
4 to 5. Your soup is done when the onions are soft and translucent and the
chicken is cooked through and begun to fall apart. Ladle into a wide-mouth
bowl and place a whole hardboiled egg into each dish.
