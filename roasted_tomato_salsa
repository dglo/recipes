Roasted Tomato Salsa

7 firm medium tomatoes, cold
1 small jalapeno
1 clove garlic
1 tsp. Salt
1 1/2 cups water (optional, depends on how juicy your tomatoes are)
juice of 1 lime
4 tablespoons chopped cilantro (fresh)

Heat grill (I use the gas grill to control the heat better) so it is really
hot.  Mine got up to about 500 degrees.  Place the tomatoes and jalapenos on
the grill (tomatoes on main grill, jalapenos on upper tray) and grill until
they are completely black.  For medium tomatoes it takes about 45 minutes.

Throw everything in the blender or food processor and pulse until smooth.

You'll be hard pressed not to dip chips even though its still warm!  I have
kept this in the fridge for up to a week, but usually can it in a water bath
for 30 minutes in pint or quart size jars.
