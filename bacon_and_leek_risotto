Yield: Serves 8 (serving size: about 2/3 cup)
Hands-on: 50 Minutes
Total: 50 Minutes

5 cups unsalted chicken stock (such as Swanson)
2 cups water
4 bacon slices
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 cups thinly sliced leek (about 4 large)
1/2 cup sliced shallots
1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 cups uncooked Arborio rice
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
2 ounces Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated (about 1/2 cup)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

Bring stock and 2 cups water to a simmer in a medium saucepan (do not boil).
Keep warm over low heat.

Cook bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove
bacon from pan; crumble. Add oil to pan; swirl to coat. Add leek, shallots,
thyme, and garlic to pan; saute 4 minutes or until tender. Stir in rice; cook
2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup stock mixture; cook 5 minutes or until liquid is
nearly absorbed, stirring constantly. Reserve 1/3 cup stock mixture. Add
remaining stock mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, stirring constantly until liquid
is absorbed before adding more (about 25 minutes total). Stir in lemon juice,
butter, pepper, salt, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Remove pan from heat. Stir in
reserved 1/3 cup stock mixture. Sprinkle with reserved bacon and chopped
parsley. Serve immediately.
