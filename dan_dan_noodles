Dan Dan Noodles

Serves 4 as part of a multi-course meal, or 2 to 3 as a single dish

6 ounces ground pork or beef
1 tablespoon peanut oil
2 teaspoons minced garlic (about 2 cloves)
1 teaspoon minced ginger
2 scallions, white and green parts chopped
2 tablespoons chopped Sichuan preserved vegetable (optional)
1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine or dry sherry
1/2 teaspoon salt, or salt to taste
8 ounces dried Chinese egg noodles
1 handful dry-roasted peanuts, finely chopped

Sauce:
1/4 cup chicken stock
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 tablespoon Chinese sesame paste or tahini
1 tablespoon Chinese black rice vinegar, or substitute good quality balsamic
  vinegar
3 tablespoons chili oil (adjust according to your tolerance of spiciness)
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon ground Sichuan pepper

Bring a large pot of water to boil and cook the noodles according to package
instructions. Drain the noodles, rinse under cold water, and drain again.
Transfer the noodles to a serving dish.

Prepare the sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together the chicken stock, soy
sauce, sesame paste, vinegar, chili oil, sesame oil, sugar, and Sichuan pepper.
Pour the sauce over the noodles and toss so the sauce is evenly distributed.
Set aside.

Heat a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and swirl to
coat the base and sides. Add the garlic, ginger, white parts of the scallions,
and optional Sichuan preserved vegetable and cook until fragrant, about 30
seconds. Add the meat and stir-fry until the meat is a little crispy on the
outside and no longer pink. Add rice wine to deglaze the pan. Season with salt
to taste.

Spoon the cooked meat mixture over the noodles, sprinkle the chopped scallions
greens and chopped peanuts on top, and serve.
