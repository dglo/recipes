Prep time: 10 mins
Cook time: 30 mins
Serves: 4

3 medium zucchini, sliced into 1/2 inch circles, or half circles
4-5 tomatoes, seeded and chopped into 1 inch pieces
1 large bell pepper, cut into 1/4 - 1/2 inch strips
1 large onion, sliced into half circles
6 garlic cloves, sliced or minced
salt, pepper
1/4 cup olive oil
dry herbs, optional
juice of 1/2 a lemon, optional
1 Tablespoon fresh parsley and/or basil, minced

Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with aluminum foil. Preheat the oven to 450
degrees.  Prep the vegetables. Toss all the vegetables with the olive oil.
Season with salt and pepper.

Spread the vegetables on the two prepared baking sheets. You can also fit all
the vegetables onto one rimmed baking sheet, but the vegetables will be softer
and you will need to roast them longer.

Bake in the preheated oven for 18-25 minutes, until the vegetables are
softened and as charred in some places as you like. Add the lemon juice and
fresh herbs. This is a dish that can be served hot or cold.

Notes:
You can also prepare this dish in a large, deep skillet.

Heat the oil in the skillet, add the onions, season with salt and pepper and
cook for about 5 minutes until they are softened. Add the peppers and garlic,
season with salt and pepper. Cook for 3-5 minutes more. Add the zucchini and
tomatoes last, since they cook the fastest, also seasoning with salt and
pepper and lastly add the fresh herbs. If your tomatoes aren't very acidic,
you may wish to add some freshly squeezed lemon juice.
