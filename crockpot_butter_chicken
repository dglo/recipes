https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018803-slow-cooker-butter-chicken

3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 medium yellow onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
3 tablespoons grated ginger
1 tablespoon garam masala
1 6-ounce can tomato paste
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 2-inch pieces
1 teaspoon lime zest
1 tablespoon lime juice
1 cup coconut milk (if necessary, whisk to combine the liquid and solids before measuring)
1/2 cup chicken stock
1/4 cup cilantro leaves, for garnish (optional)
Cooked basmati or jasmine rice, for serving

In medium skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onions to skillet, and
cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add garlic and
ginger, and cook another 2 minutes. Add garam masala, tomato paste and salt;
cook and stir 2 minutes.

Place chicken pieces in a slow cooker, then add tomato paste mixture, lime
zest and juice, coconut milk and chicken stock. Stir everything together,
cover and cook on low heat setting for 4 1/2 to 5 hours, until the chicken is
cooked through. (You may let it cook up to 7 hours if necessary, but the
chicken may be very soft and shred.) Garnish with cilantro and serve with
basmati or jasmine rice, and naan if you have some.
