Gin & Tonic Refrigerator Pickles
http://theviewfromgreatisland.com/gin-and-tonic-refrigerator-pickles/

5-7 small Persian or pickling cucumbers
1 Tbsp of juniper berries
3/4 cup gin
3/4 cup tonic water
juice of 1 lime
2 Tbsp Roses lime juice

Wash and trim the stem tips from the cucumbers. Slice them in half lengthwise,
and then in half again. Trim them to the length of your jar. You want the
spears to fit in the jar and eventually be completely submerged in liquid when
you are finished.

Mix the gin, tonic water, fresh lime juice and the Rose's.

Lightly crush the juniper berries to release their flavor. Fit the pickle
spears into a clean glass jar. Fill the jar but don't pack them in super
tightly.

Add the juniper berries, and then the liquid mixture. Top off with more tonic
water if the spears aren't completely submerged.

Cap the jar tightly and refrigerate. Let the pickles 'pickle' for 2 days
before eating.

The pickles will keep for at least a month in the fridge.
