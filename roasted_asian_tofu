Roasted Asian Tofu

1 Tbsp rice vinegar or balsamic vinegar
1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil
1 Tbsp Tamari soy sauce
1 tsp sugar or agave syrup
1 Tbsp minced fresh ginger OR 1/2 tsp ground ginger
1 Tbsp minced fresh garlic OR 1/2 tsp powdered garlic
1/2 cup chopped scallions
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp coriander
pinch cayenne
fresh ground black pepper

Open a package of extra-firm tofu, pour out the liquid, and gently squeeze the
tofu between the palm of your hands to get rid of the excess water.
Cut the tofu into one-inch chunks. Place the tofu in a medium sized bowl.
In a small bowl, combine all of the marinade ingredients and whisk them
together, or screw on a lid and shake until well combined.
Drizzle the marinade over the tofu and toss to coat evenly. Cover the tofu
with a lid.
Let the tofu marinate in the fridge, anywhere from 30 minutes to a full day.
I let mine marinate overnight.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Toss the marinated tofu onto the baking sheet and spread the tofu in an even
layer.
Bake for 15 minutes, flip the tofu so it bakes evenly, and return to the oven
for another 15 minutes. Enjoy!
