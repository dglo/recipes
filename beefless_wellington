1 batch prepared puff pastry
1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas rinsed and drained
1 cup cooked quinoa
1/2 cup diced carrots
1/2 cup diced green bell pepper
1/2 cups diced yellow onion
1 cup diced mushrooms (any kind will work)  
3 cloves minced garlic
2 tbs of butter
1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce
1-11/2 cups seasoned bread crumbs
Salt and pepper to taste
1 beaten egg for egg wash  

In your food processor puree your chickpeas. With a rubber spatula scrape
chickpeas out into a large mixing bowl. Mix with cooked quinoa

Meanwhile in a medium sauce pan saute diced vegetables and garlic in the 2 tbs
of butter until tender. Remove from pan and dice in your food processor. You
want the pieces to be teeny tiny... but not pureed.  Remove from food
processor and mix into the chickpea mixture. 

Using a rubber spatula mix in the Worcestershire sauce and add the bread
crumbs a 1/2 cup at a time. Mix in bread crumbs just until the mixture comes
together and can be formed into a ball or loaf. It should resemble hamburger
in texture. 

On a lightly floured surface roll out your puff pastry to a 1.5ft x 1.5ft
square. Shape your vegetable mixture into a loaf shape on top of the pastry on
one end leaving about 1-2 inches of pastry on the top and bottom. Fold the top
and bottoms up over the log and begin to roll it in the pastry wrapping it
tight in pastry. Place on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet.

Brush pastry with a beaten egg.

Bake at 375 for about 25 minutes. Or until it is golden on all sides. Allow it
to cool for 15 minute before slicing.
