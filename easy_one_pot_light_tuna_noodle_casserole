Total: 15 mins
Serves: 4 servings

6 ounces dried wide egg noodles
Kosher salt
6 ounces creme fraîche
1 large egg
2 teaspoons cornstarch
2 tablespoons juice from 1 to 2 lemons, divided
Freshly ground black pepper
1 (12-ounce) can tuna, drained and broken up into bite-sized chunks
1 cup frozen peas
1/4 cup picked fresh parsley
Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling (optional)
Crushed potato chips, for topping (optional)

Place noodles in a large saucepan or skillet and cover with room temperature
tap water by 1 inch. Season lightly with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat
and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost done (follow package directions
for cook times). Drain all but 1 cup of water. Return to high heat and simmer
until water is almost completely reduced.

Meanwhile, combine crème fraîche, egg, cornstarch, and 1 tablespoon lemon
juice in a medium bowl and whisk with a fork or whisk until homogenous.

When noodles are cooked, add crème fraîche mixture to skillet and cook,
stirring and tossing constantly, until sauce thickens and coats noodles.
Season generously with black pepper and salt. Off heat, gently fold in tuna,
peas, parsley, and remaining lemon juice until warmed through. Serve
immediately drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkled with crushed
potato chips, if desired.

Note: To make a more traditional casserole, transfer hot tuna noodle mixture
to a baking dish. Top with crushed potato chips or bread crumbs and broil
about 8 inches from the broiler element until crisp and browned on top.
