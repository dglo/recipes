Serves 4 to 6
Prep Time: 10 min
Cook Time: 30 min

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
2 medium leeks, white and light green parts, chopped (2 cups)
2 celery stalks, diced
16 ounces cremini mushrooms, chopped
2 tablespoons tamari
1/4 cup dry white wine
2 large garlic cloves, chopped
2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
4 cups vegetable broth
1 pound cauliflower, broken into florets (5 cups)
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

Topping options:
Drizzles of full-fat coconut milk
Saut√©ed Mushrooms
Croutons
Toasted pine nuts
Microgreens or tender thyme leaves

Heat the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the leeks,
celery, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add
the mushrooms and cook until soft, 8 to 10 minutes more.

Stir in the tamari, wine, garlic, and thyme and cook for 30 seconds to
1 minute, or until the wine has evaporated. Add the broth and the cauliflower.

Simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, or until the cauliflower is very soft.
Transfer to a blender, add the mustard and vinegar, and blend until smooth. If
your soup is too thick, add a little bit of water to the blender to reach a
creamy consistency. Season to taste and serve with desired toppings.
