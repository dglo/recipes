OATMEAL/WHOLE WHEAT PANCAKES

1 egg
1 1/4 c. milk
2 tbsp. oil
1/2 c. whole wheat flour
1/2 c. all purpose flour
1 tsp. sugar
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
1/2 c. oats (can be thick cut, regular, quick)

If using sour or buttermilk, use 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon soda.

Beat egg, add milk and oil. Sift all purpose flour, sugar, baking powder,
soda and salt; add along with whole wheat flour and oats to liquid. Mix just
