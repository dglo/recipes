Potato Balls in Tomato Sauce

5-7 medium sized potatoes
olive oil for sauteeing
1 large onion, diced
28 ounce can tomato sauce
1-2 tablespoons Southwestern Chipotle spice mix
sugar to taste
2-4 thyme sprigs
sour cream

Cook potatoes in salted water until tender. Peel and mash.

Meanwhile, heat your skillet. Add oil, allow it to heat, and add onions. Saute
the onions until they are golden brown. This might take about 20 minutes. Add
to the mashed potatoes and season with salt and pepper.

At the same time, in a medium-sized pot, combine tomato sauce with
Southwestern Chipotle spices, sugar and thyme sprigs. Let the sauce bubble.

In a separate skillet, heat enough oil to cover the bottom. Form golf-sized
balls from the potato/onion mixture and saute in oil until slightly brown and
warmed through. {You might want to do this in a nonstick skillet. I browned
mine in Le Creuset, and most of them stuck to the bottom.} Throw in a few
sprigs of thyme and allow them to crisp up.

Serve the potato balls in a puddle of tomato sauce. Garnish with crispy thyme
sprigs and sour cream.
