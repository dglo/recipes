Peanut Butter M&M Cookies
Ingredients:
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
1 cup light brown sugar
1 cup reduced-fat creamy peanut butter
2 tbsp. milk
2 eggs
2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 ½ tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. baking powder
½ tsp. salt
1 lb. milk chocolate M&Ms

Directions:
Combine butter, sugar, brown sugar, peanut butter and milk in a large bowl. Beat until well blended. Beat in eggs. Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add gradually on low speed. Gently stir in the M&Ms.

Preheat the oven to 375° F. Shape the dough into 1 ¼” balls and place on ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes, checking frequently to avoid over-baking. Allow to cool for a few minutes on the cookie sheet before transferring to a cooling rack and cooling completely.
