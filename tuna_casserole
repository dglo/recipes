Prep Time: 10 min
Cook Time: 40 min
Servings: 6 to 8 servings

1 tablespoon salt
12 ounces wide egg noodles
2 cups chopped broccoli (about 1/2 pound)
8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms
2 tablespoons butter
1 medium onion, chopped
2 (6-ounce) cans tuna, drained
1 (10.5-ounce) can cream of mushroom soup
2 1/2 cups grated cheddar cheese
1/3 cup milk
1 tablespoon cream
Salt and pepper, to taste
1 cup crushed potato chips

Preheat the oven to 400F

In a large (6-quart) pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add a tablespoon
of salt. Return to a boil, then add the noodles. Cook uncovered on high heat
on a rolling boil.

Just before pasta is al dente (firm but cooked through, earliest cooking time
minus 2 minutes), add the chopped broccoli to the pasta and cook for 2 more
minutes.

Drain in a colander and set aside.

While the pasta is cooking, dry saute the mushrooms in a frying pan on
medium-high heat (There's no need to add butter or oil. Mushrooms will cook in
their own juices.).

When mushrooms have given up their moisture (about 5 to 10 minutes), remove
from heat and set aside.

When the pasta is draining in a colander, heat a large oven-proof pan on
medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and melt. Add the onion and cook
until translucent.

Put the pasta and broccoli mixture back into the pot. Stir in the mushrooms,
the drained tuna, can of cream of mushroom soup, grated cheese, milk and
cream. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Spread crushed potato chips over the top of the mixture.

Cook for 20 minutes in the oven at 400Â°F, until the topping has browned.
