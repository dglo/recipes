Chicken Tinga

1 large tomato, quartered
4 large tomatoes, chopped
2 onions, quartered
3 onions, chopped
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 7 ounce can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
4 teaspoons of salt, more or less to taste
2 pounds skinless/boneless chicken breast
6 cups of water
1/4 cup of corn oil

Toppings
Corn Tostadas, freshly made or store bought
Iceberg lettuce, finely sliced (optional)
Avocado, pitted, peeled and sliced
Mexican crema or sour cream
Queso fresco or Cotija, crumbled
Salsa of your choice (optional)
Radishes, sliced (optional)

In a medium sized pot: place chicken, 6 cups of water, 2 teaspoons of salt,
1 garlic clove, and 2 quarters of an onion. Cover and simmer for about 30
minutes on medium to high heat. Reserve the stock. Allow the chicken to cool
and then shred it.

In a blender add the remainder of the quartered onion and 1 tomato, a can of
chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 chopped garlic
clove, and enough chicken broth to fill the blender half way and blend until
smooth.

Heat the oil in a large and deep pan over medium heat. Once it is hot but not
smoking, stir in the chopped onion and cook until soft and translucent, for
about 5 to 6 minutes. Then add chopped tomato and cook for an additional 10
minutes. Add the cooked shredded chicken, the chipotle sauce from the blender
and more chicken broth if it is too dry. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and
simmer covered for 10 minutes. Add salt to taste.

In heavy skillet heat one-quarter inch oil. Fry tortillas, one at a time, in
hot oil for 20 to 40 seconds on each side or till crisp and golden. Drain on
paper towels. Keep warm in foil in 250 degrees oven. Store bought tostadas can
also be used.

To assemble, place a warm tostada on a serving plate; spoon on chicken tinga,
then lettuce (optional), 1 or 2 slices of ripe avocado and crumbed queso
fresco and crema or sour cream. Drizzle with your favorite homemade salsa to
taste.
