Spicy Chipotle Grilled Chicken
Bon App√©tit | July 2006

There's depth, subtlety, and just the right amount of heat here. Start
preparing this dish one day ahead since the chicken needs to marinate overnight.

Yield: Makes 4 servings

1/4 cup canned chipotle chiles in adobo*
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 garlic cloves, pressed
1/2 onion, coarsely chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 3 1/2-pound chicken, cut into 8 pieces

Nonstick vegetable oil spray

Combine chipotles in adobo, olive oil, and garlic cloves in processor; puree
until paste forms. Add chopped onion, chopped cilantro, paprika, ground cumin,
chili powder, and salt; process until onion is finely chopped. Transfer 1/4
cup chipotle mixture to small bowl; cover and refrigerate. Arrange chicken
pieces in 11x7x2-inch glass baking dish. Spread remaining chipotle mixture
all over chicken pieces. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

Spray grill rack with nonstick spray. Prepare barbecue (medium heat). Grill
chicken until cooked through, moving to cooler part of grill as needed to
prevent burning and brushing with reserved marinade during last 5 minutes of
grilling, about 30 minutes. Transfer chicken to platter and serve.
