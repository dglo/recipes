YIELD: Serves 2 to 3
ACTIVE TIME: 5 minutes
TOTAL TIME: 15 minutes

1/2 pound elbow macaroni
Kosher salt
6 oz evaporated milk
1 large egg
1/2 teaspoon Frank's RedHot or other hot sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground mustard
8 oz extra-sharp cheddar, grated (see note above)
4 oz American cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (see note below)
1/2 tablespoon cornstarch
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 4 chunks

Place the macaroni in a large saucepan and cover it with salted water by 2
inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to keep the
pasta from sticking. Cover the pan, remove from the heat, and let stand until
the pasta is barely al dente, about 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, whisk together the evaporated milk, eggs, hot sauce, and mustard in
a bowl until homogeneous. Toss the cheeses with the cornstarch in a large bowl
until thoroughly combined.

When the pasta is cooked, drain it and return it to the saucepan. Place over
low heat, add the butter, and stir until melted. Add the milk mixture and
cheese mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheese is completely
melted and the mixture is hot and creamy. Season to taste with salt and more
hot sauce. Serve immediately, topping with toasted bread crumbs if desired.

NOTE: Use a good melting cheese or combination thereof, like American, cheddar,
Jack, Fontina, young Swiss, Gruyere, Muenster, young provolone, and/or young
Gouda. To reheat the pasta, add a few tablespoons of milk to the pan and cook,
stirring gently, over medium-low heat until hot.
