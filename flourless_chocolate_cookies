Flourless Chocolate Cookies

3        cups powdered sugar
2/3     cup cocoa powder (i like the dark version)
1/4     teaspoon salt
1 1/4  cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
4        large egg whites
2        teaspoons vanilla 

Preheat oven to 350`.

Combine powdered sugar, cocoa powder, salt, and chocolate chips in a medium
bowl. Add egg whites and vanilla; stir until well-combined.

Spoon batter onto parchment-lined baking sheets in 2 tablespoon mounds or a
1 1/2-inch cookie scoop. Bake at 350 degrees for 14 minutes or until tops are
cracked and glossy, and edges look done. Cool slightly; remove to cooling rack
to cool completely.
