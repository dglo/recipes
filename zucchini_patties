Zucchini Patties    
Serves: 4

2 cups of grated zucchini (about 3 or 4 depending on size)
1 cup of provolone cheese grated (or mozzarella)
1/2 cup good Parmesan cheese grated
2 eggs beaten
1/4 cup of flour
1/4 cup of bread crumbs
1/4 cup chopped onion
salt and pepper to taste
dill chopped
some oil for frying

Start with grating the zucchini and then strain all of the water from them
using paper towels.

In a large bowl add the zucchini, Parmesan cheese, provolone cheese, onion,
flour, bread crumbs, onion, eggs and the salt and pepper and mix really well.

In a skillet heat a small amount of oil, and drop small amounts of the zucchini
mixture by tablespoonfuls and fry on both sides until golden brown.
