https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017354-the-lee-brothers-pimento-cheese

8 ounces extra-sharp cheddar cheese, grated with a food processor or hand grater (not pre-grated)
1/4 cup softened cream cheese (2 ounces), pulled into several pieces
Scant 1/2 cup jarred pimento or other roasted red peppers (from a 7-ounce jar),
    finely diced
3 tablespoons Duke’s, Hellmann’s or other high-quality store-bought mayonnaise
1/2 teaspoon dried red chile flakes
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste


In a large mixing bowl, place the cheddar cheese in an even layer. Scatter the
cream cheese, pimentos, mayonnaise and chile flakes over the cheddar cheese.
Using a spatula, mix the pimento cheese until it is smooth and spreadable,
about 1 1/2 minutes.

Transfer the pimento cheese to a plastic container or bowl, cover tightly, and
store in the refrigerator. Pimento cheese keeps in the refrigerator for 1 week.
