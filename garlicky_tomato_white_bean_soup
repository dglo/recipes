Yield: 4 servings
Time: 30 minutes

10 garlic cloves
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 (14-ounce) cans white beans, such as cannellini or great Northern,
    including their liquid
1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 cup stock or water, plus more as needed
Kosher salt and black pepper
Heavy cream, for serving

Peel the garlic, then smash the cloves using a meat pounder or the bottom of a
heavy skillet until wispy and flat.

In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, heat the olive oil, then add the
crushed garlic, and cook, smashing with the back of a wooden spoon and
stirring occasionally, until golden brown and beginning to stick to the bottom
of the pan, 3 to 5 minutes.

Add the white beans and their liquid, crushed tomatoes, stock or water, and
season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then partly cover, reduce heat,
and let simmer until thickened and fragrant, 15 to 20 minutes.

Using an immersion or regular blender, pur√©e the soup until smooth. Add cream
or stock or water to thin as desired. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Drizzle with heavy cream before serving.
