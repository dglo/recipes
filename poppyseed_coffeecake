Prep Time: 40 minutes
Cook Time: 35 minutes
Total Time: 2 hours, 45 minutes
Makes: One loaf


Dough:
1 1/2 cups bread (or all purpose) flour
1 packet (2 tsp/7 gms/1/4 oz) yeast - instant or active dry yeast
1/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

2/3 cup 1% milk heated to 120-130F for instant yeast (or 110-120F for
    active dry)
2 Tablespoons oil (I use canola oil or extra light olive oil)
1 egg
about 3/4 cup extra flour

Filling:
1 cup poppy seeds
1/3 cup boiling water
1/4 cup ground toasted almonds (20 count)
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
zest of 1/2 a lemon & 1/2 an orange

Grind poppy seeds (see note below).
Place in a small bowl, stir in boiling water & let stand uncovered.
Grind almonds and set aside.
Place flour, yeast, sugar, & salt in large mixing bowl.
Stir in milk followed by oil & egg.
Beat on high for 2 minutes. Stir in extra flour until dough forms a mass.
Place dough on floured board and knead 100 turns (about 2 minutes). Cover & let rest 10 minutes.
Meantime, add ground almonds, sugar, vanilla & zests to poppy seeds.
Roll dough into a 10 x 12 shape. Spread filling almost to edges, roll starting
at 10-inch end and place on parchment-lined baking sheet, seam side down.
Pinch and tuck ends under.
Cover with a towel and rise in a warm spot for 1 1/2 hours or until double in
size.
Preheat oven to 350° F and bake for 35 minutes.
Cool for 10 minutes & drizzle with glaze (1 cup powdered sugar + about 2 Tbsp.
milk, added slowly)
(Another option): Before baking, you can brush with eggwash and sprinkle with
poppy seeds.

Note: If using a spice grinder (mine is a Cuisinart Spice & Nut Grinder) grind
seeds slowly, 2 Tbsp. at a time, until they feel moist – about 10 seconds per
each portion. Scoop out any that stick to the bottom of the grinder as you go.
Once they are all ground, I use the same grinder to grind the almonds.
