Dave's Recipe Collection

I use the `random_week.py` script to help create my weekly meal plan.  The
script reads in the list of all recipes, as well as any meals listed in the
`simple_meals` file, then prints out 30 random meals.  I'll run the script
2-3 times and choose the meals that sound good.
