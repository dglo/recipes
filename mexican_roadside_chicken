Mexican Roadside Chicken
Adapted from Mexican Everyday by Rick Bayless

Ingredients
1 1/2 teaspoons ground ancho chile powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican
A big pinch of ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped or crushed through a garlic press
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup fresh orange juice
1 teaspoon Kosher salt, plus a little more for the onions

1 large chicken, about 3 lbs, butterflied
2 large bunches of green onions or knob onions
A little olive oil for brushing the onions
Grilled tomatillo salsa, for serving

Procedure
Light a chimney 3/4 full of charcoal. While the charcoal is lighting, mix
chile powder, oregano, cloves, cinnamon, garlic, vinegar, orange juice, and
1 teaspoon of salt together in a small bowl.

When the charcoal is fully lit and covered in gray ash, pour coals out and
arrange them on one side of the charcoal grate, keeping the other side empty.
Place the chicken over the cool side of the grill, skin side down, and brush
exposed side with the wet rub. Flip the chicken over and brush the other side
with the rub. Cover the grill and cook, basting occasionally with any
remaining rub, at 350 degrees until an instant read thermometer reads 165
degrees when inserted into the thickest part of the breast, about 45 minutes.
Remove the chicken from the grill and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.

While the chicken is resting, brush the onions with olive oil and season with
salt. Place the onions over the hot side of the grill and cook until tender
and browned, about 5 minutes per side.

To serve, cut the chicken into quarters, top with green onions and tomatillo
salsa.
