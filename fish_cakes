Fish Cakes

2 lbs boneless tilapia filet
Juice of 1 lime
1 tsp thyme leave, removed from stem
2 tbsp parsley
1 scallion
3 cloves garlic
1 tbsp black pepper
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
1/4 cup mayo
1 tsp salt
5 slices bread
Oil

Place the slices of bread in a food processor and pulse until it's crumbly.
Put the bread crumbs in a bowl. Next place the fish in a food processor and
pulse until the fish is chopped coarsely; you do not want the fish to become a
paste. If you do not have a food processor, chop with a knife.

Place the fish back into a bowl. Finely chop the thyme, parsley, scallion and
garlic then add to the bowl with the fish. Add about 1/3 of fresh bread crumbs,
black pepper, red pepper flakes, mayo, salt and lime juice and mix to combine.
Place remaining bread crumbs onto a plate. Spoon about 1/3 cup of the fish into
the palm of your hands and form into a 1 1/2 inch thick patty then lightly coat
the fish cake with the bread crumbs. Place on a pan lined with parchment paper
then repeat with the remaining fish.

Place enough oil in a frying pan that's about 1 inch deep. Heat oil over medium
fire; once oil is hot, lower the heat to medium low. Fry fish cakes for 5
minutes per side until golden brown, flipping only once. You do not want to
move the fish cakes too much or it may fall apart. If the fish cakes brown too
quickly, then lower the fire. Once the fish cakes are golden, remove from the
fire and place on a plate lined with paper towel to drain.
