The hot sauce enhances the flavor of this Pacific favorite. Rich salmon flakes
blend with crisp potatoes and a hint of garlic to make a light but satisfying
dish.

Seattle Salmon Hash
6 tablespoons vegetable oil 
2 potatoes, peeled and cut in 1/2 inch dice 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 
1/2 onion, diced 
3 cloves garlic, minced 
2 sweet bell peppers, seeded and cut in 1 inch dice 
12 ounces skinless salmon fillet, cut in 1 inch cubes 
1 teaspoon thyme 
2 tablespoons lemon juice 
1 teaspoon hot sauce

Heat half the oil in a large nonstick skillet over high heat. Fry the potatoes
with half the salt and pepper until crisp and golden brown all over, about 10
minutes. Remove from heat; drain on paper towels.
Pour remaining oil into the pan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, cook
about 1 minute. Add bell peppers and cook until softened, 10 minutes longer.
Clear a space in the center of the pan; increase heat to medium-high.
Season salmon with remaining salt, pepper and thyme; add salmon to the pan.
Cook until golden all over, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, stir in
lemon juice and hot sauce; add potatoes. Cook until potatoes are heated
through, 3 to 4 more minutes. Adjust seasonings and serve.

Makes 6 servings.
