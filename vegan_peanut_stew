Vegan Peanut Stew
http://mylittlecelebration.com/vegan-peanut-stew/
heavily adapted from The Vegan Stoner

1 potato, chopped*
1 white onion, diced
1 teaspoon garlic, minced
1 14 oz. can crushed {stewed} tomatoes
1 can garbanzo beans, drained
pinch of thyme {I used dried}
1-2 cups water, depending on thickness preference
1 cup peanut butter {I used natural creamy salted}

Cook onion over medium heat until soft and translucent. Add garlic and stir.
Then add tomatoes, peanut butter, garbanzo beans, and stir. Season with thyme
and add potato. Depending on desired thickness, add 1-2 cups water and stir.
Then cover and cook on low-medium low heat for 25-35 minutes. The soup is
ready when the potatoes are cooked through and a sample reveals a delicious,
peanutty flavor.

*note: The potato takes a while to cook all the way through if you add it to
the soup raw, so I would recommend microwaving it for a minute or two before
chopping to speed up cooking time.
