RED, GOLD, BLACK AND GREEN CHILI from Moosewood Cooks at Home

1/2 c bulghur
1/2 c hot water
1 28 oz can tomatoes (3 c undrained)
***
3 c chopped onions
3 garlic cloves
1 t ground cumin
1 t chili powder
1 T tabasco or other hot pepper sauce (or 1/4 t cayenne)
***
2 green peppers chopped
2 c fresh or frozen cut corn
1 1/2 c drained black beans ( 1 14 oz can)
1 1/2 c drained red kidney beans ( 1 14 oz can)

Place the bulghur, hot water, and about a cup of the juice from the canned
tomatoes in a small saucepan (Note: Since I used crushed tomatoes, it was
mostly water with a little of the liquid off the top)

Cover and Bring to a boil on high heat, then lower the heat and simmer gently

While the bulghur cooks, heat the olive oil in a large pan and saute' the
onions, garlic, cumin, chili powder, and tabasco or cayenne

When the onions are soft, stir in the bell peppers and saute' for
2 to 3 minutes more.

Chop the tomatoes right in the can (unless they're crushed) and add them to
the pan. Stir in the corn and beans.

Heat thoroughly on low heat.

Taste the bulghur. When it is cooked but still chewy, add it to the pan with
it's liquid.

Cover and simmer for a few minutes for the flavors to meld. Add salt to taste.
Serve plain or topped with grated cheese and fresh cilantro
