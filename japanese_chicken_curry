4 Tablespoons butter
1 Tablespoon fresh peeled and finely grated ginger
2 medium onions, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1/3 cup all purpose flour
4 Tablespoons curry powder
3 Tablespoons tomato paste
3 medium carrots, cut into 1/2 inch chunks
2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4 inch chunks
1 small apple, peeled, cored and coarsely grated
1 Tablespoon honey
2 Tablespoons soy sauce
Rice of your preference for serving

In a large skillet (preferably cast iron), heat pan over high heat. Add canola
oil and allow to heat until shimmering. Meanwhile, cut chicken to an even 1
inch dice, salt and pepper moderately. Add chicken to skillet and cook for
4-5 minutes until golden brown. Remove from heat.

In a large saucepan over medium low heat add butter and allow it to melt. Add
ginger, garlic, and onions. Cook until translucent 3-5 minutes. Add flour, stir
well and continue to cook, browning for 2-3 extra minutes. Add tomato paste and
curry powder. Stir well to combine evenly (it will be thick and a little
clumpy).

As soon as tomato paste and curry is evenly combined, add chicken stock. Bring
to a boil. Add chicken, carrots and potatoes. Bring to a boil again
(temperature reduces when you add other ingredients). Reduce heat to medium low
(simmering) and cook for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally until vegetables
are tender. Stir in apple, honey, and soy sauce. Cook for another few minutes,
until apples are not too noticeable. Taste and adjust salt if needed.

Serve over rice.
