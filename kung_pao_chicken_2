Authentic Kung Pao Chicken

INGREDIENTS
2-3 chicken breasts, diced
1 tsp salt
1 tsp cornstarch
1 dash soy sauce
1 carrot, diced
1 stalk Chinese lettuce root, diced (optional, if you can't find it use celery)
1/2 cup peanuts
1/4 cup cooking oil
3 tbsp Chinese oyster sauce
1 tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 tsp Sichuan hot pepper paste, optional

DIRECTIONS
In a small bowl, combine diced chicken, salt, cornstarch, and soy sauce. Mix
thoroughly and let sit a few minutes. Meanwhile, dry-roast the peanuts. Heat
wok or skillet to med high heat and add peanuts, tossing occasionally till
peanuts begin to "pop." Reduce heat to med/low, and continue to roast 3-4 more
minutes. These peanuts can be crushed or added whole to the stir-fry (later).

Heat cooking oil in wok or skillet over med/ high heat till oil begins to
ripple or shimmer. Add chicken and stir-fry 2-3 minutes, then remove chicken
only using slotted spoon so oil stays in wok. Add carrots and lettuce root
and stir-fry 1-2 minutes till just beginning to turn tender-crisp. Return
chicken to pot and add peanuts (crushed or whole), oyster sauce, sugar,
sesame oil, and hot pepper paste if you want the dish to be spicy. Add a
little water to thin sauce if desired. Stir to mix, then allow sauce to come
to a boil. Stir again and serve.
