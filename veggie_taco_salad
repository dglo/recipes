Veggie Times Taco Salad
4 servings

NOTE: Instead of making the tortilla bowls, I just serve the salad in bowls
with toasted tortilla chips on top

4 whole wheat tortillas
Cooking spray
15 ounce can pinto beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup yellow or green bell pepper, chopped
1/3 cup onion, chopped
2 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
4 cups salad greens, torn
1 medium tomato, chopped
Cheddar cheese, shredded
Salsa
Non-fat yogurt (optional)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Spray each tortilla and gently press them into custard cups or other small
baking dishes. Bake until crisp, approximately 15 minutes.

Spray a medium skillet with cooking spray. Add beans, pepper, onion, tamari,
garlic, chili powder and cumin and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, or
until heated through, stirring constantly.

When tortillas have finished baking, remove them from the baking dishes and
fill each with 1 cup of salad greens. Top the greens with the bean mixture,
salsa, cheese and yogurt.
