Blueberry Pie Pancakes

(Serves 1)

1/2 cup blueberries
1/3 cup flour (ww pastry, white, spelt, Bob’s gluten-free, etc.)
2 T rolled oats
1/2 tsp cinnamon
2/3 tsp baking powder
1/8 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1 T sugar or 1 packet stevia (omit if you don’t want sweet pancakes)
1/3 cup nondairy milk

If you don’t like the taste of fat-free pancakes, add 1 T oil or vegan butter,
and reduce milk by that amount

Combine dry ingredients in a bowl, then add wet. Mix, but don’t overmix. Cook
on an oiled (or sprayed) pan, on low-medium, flipping each pancake once.

Top with syrup or powdered sugar.  You could even boil some more blueberries
(with a bit of sugar, if you wish), and smash them, to make a compote.
