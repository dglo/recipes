Chipotle Bean Burritos

2 tsp vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp chile powder
2 tsp minced chipotle chile in adobo sauce
1 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp kosher salt
1/3 c water, chicken broth, or vegetable broth
1 15-oz can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 15-oz can pinto beans, drained and rinsed
6 tbsp fresh salsa
6 12-inch flour tortillas, warmed in microwave for 10-15 seconds
1 c shredded cheese (cheddar, pepper jack, monterey jack, or a mixture)
1 1/2 c chopped tomatoes
1 1/2 c chopped romaine lettuce
6 tbsp thinly sliced scallions
6 tbsp sour cream

Heat the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Add the garlic,
chile powder, chipotle chile, cumin, and salt, and cook until fragrant, about
1 minute.  Add the beans and broth, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to
medium-low, and allow to simmer 10 minutes.  Remove from heat, stir in salsa,
and mash lightly with a slotted spoon or fork.

Spoon about 1/3 c of the bean mixture down the center of each tortilla.  Top
each serving with about 2 1/2 tbsp shredded cheese, 1/4 c tomatoes, 1/4 c
lettuce, 1 tbsp green onion, and 1 tbsp sour cream.  Roll tightly and serve
immediately.
