Prep time: 5 minutes
Cook time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings

3-4 chicken breasts, cut into large strips or chunks
salt and black pepper, to taste
1 teaspoon olive oil
4 creamy Swiss cheese wedges (I use Laughing Cow)
2/3 cup chicken broth
Instructions

Season chicken strips or chunks with salt and black pepper.
Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
Add chicken and sear on both sides until browned, about 2-3 minutes per side.
Add cheese wedges and chicken broth, scraping up any stuck-on bits on the bottom of the pan.
Reduce heat to medium-low and cook until the cheese has melted, the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Serve chicken with extra sauce drizzled over the top. Devour!
