Cheesy Peasy Pasta

1 13 oz box medium pasta shells
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons flour
3 cups milk
2 cups Italian blend shredded cheese (mozarella, provolone, parmesan)
2 cups fresh peas, shelled
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup onion, finely chopped
1 teaspoon Italian blend dried herbs (basil, oregano and rosemary)
salt and pepper to taste

Cook pasta according to package directions, drain well.

Add butter to a skillet and melt. Add garlic and onion. Saute until
translucent. Add flour and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until it smells nutty,
whisking constantly.

Add milk, herbs and peas.  Whisk until it comes to a bubble. Simmer for about
5 minutes, until thickened and add cheese. Remove from heat and add pasta.
Stir until well incorporated.

Peas will be crisp, and burst when you bite into them. If you want soft peas,
use defrosted frozen ones, or boil peas until desired tenderness before adding
to sauce.
