Cooking spray
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
3/4 cup chopped yellow onion
1/2 cup chopped celery
1 tablespoon peanut oil
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 cups fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons no-salt-added tomato paste
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce (such as Tabasco)
1 (10-ounce) package frozen whole-kernel corn, thawed
1 (10-ounce) package frozen baby lima beans, thawed
6 (1-ounce) slices Italian bread, toasted
2 garlic cloves, halved 

Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking spray.
Add bell pepper, onion, and celery to pan; cook 5 minutes, stirring
occasionally. Add oil to pan. Combine flour and chicken in a medium bowl,
tossing to coat. Add chicken to pan; cook 2 minutes or until lightly browned.
Gradually stir in broth; bring to a boil. Cook 1 minute or until slightly
thick, stirring constantly. Add tomato paste and next 5 ingredients (through
lima beans) to pan. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes.

Rub bread slices with cut sides of garlic; discard garlic. Serve bread with
stew.
