1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
1 medium red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and diced
1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce
1/2 cup ketchup
2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon dry ground mustard 
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (no salt added)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
6 hamburger buns, for serving

Add the ingredients to the slow cooker: Place all the ingredients except the
buns in the insert of a 4-quart or larger slow cooker. Stir until everything
is well-combined, making sure to break up the beef.

Cook the sloppy joes: Cover the slow cooker with the lid. Cook on low for 6 to
8 hours, or on high for 2 to 3 hours. Stir the mixture again.

Assemble the sloppy joes: Divide the sloppy joe mixture between the hamburger
buns and serve immediately.
