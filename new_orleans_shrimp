4 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1-1/2 to 2 pounds peeled shrimp
2 tablespoons Worcestershire or soy sauce
Salt to taste
1/2 teaspoon or more fresh black pepper
Juice of 1 lemon
2 scallions, thinly sliced

Put butter in skillet, and turn heat to high; when it melts, add garlic,
shrimp, and Worcestershire or soy sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
sauce is thick and shrimp uniformly pink, about 5 minutes. If sauce threatens
to dry out, add a tablespoon or two of water.

When shrimp are done, add salt and pepper, then lemon juice and scallions.
Serve over rice or with bread.
