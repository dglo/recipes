Chinese Style Tilapia

1 pound tilapia fillets
3 Tbsp rice cooking wine
2-3 scallions, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 1/2 Tbsp low sodium soy sauce
1/2 Tbsp Sriracha chili sauce
2 cloves of garlic, diced
1/4 tsp dried ginger powder
1 tsp olive oil

In a medium sized skillet, heat olive oil over low-medium heat. In a small
bowl combine rice cooking wine, soy sauce, Sriracha chili sauce, garlic &
ginger powder. Add fish to skillet, cooking for a minute. FLIP the fish (I
almost forgot this step) and add soy sauce mixture to skillet. Add green
onion. Allow fish to simmer over low heat until cooked thoroughly.
Serve immediately.
