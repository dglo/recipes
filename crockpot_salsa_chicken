Crockpot Salsa Chicken

Throw in a package of chicken breasts. Sprinkle with taco seasoning. Cover
with jarred salsa. Cook all day on low while you're at work. When you get
home, remove the chicken and shred it with forks, then return it to the
crockpot. Stir in some sour cream and a drained, rinsed can of black beans.
Voila! Perfect burrito filling. Or you can eat it over rice.
