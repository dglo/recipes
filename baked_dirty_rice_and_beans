Baked Louisiana Dirty Rice and Beans

This spicy casserole, an old New Orleans favorite, traditionally features
chicken livers and gizzards. This version substitutes juicy chicken thighs.
Brown rice adds a nutty, earthy taste.


1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup finely chopped green bell pepper
3/4 cup finely chopped red onion
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
1/2 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
1 cup uncooked long-grain brown rice
2 1/2 cups fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
1/2 cup thinly sliced green onions
2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 (15-ounce) can red kidney beans, rinsed and drained

Preheat oven to 350°.

Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add bell pepper, red onion,
and celery to pan; cook 4 minutes or until vegetables are tender, stirring
occasionally. Add chicken; cook 3 minutes or until lightly browned. Stir in
rice; cook 30 seconds. Add broth and remaining ingredients; bring to a simmer.
Cover and bake at 350° for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until liquid is absorbed
and rice is tender.

Yield:  6 servings (serving size: about 1 cup)
