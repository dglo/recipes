Falafel Balls

15 oz can chickpeas, drained
1 medium onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
2 Tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley
2 Tbsp finely chopped fresh cilantro
1/2-1 tsp dried hot red pepper
4 cloves of garlic
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp baking powder
4-6 Tbsp flour
Soybean or vegetable oil for frying
Chopped tomato for garnish
Diced onion for garnish
Diced green bell pepper for garnish
Tahina sauce
Pita bread

Yogurt Sauce Ingredients:
1 cup plain nonfat yogurt
1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, chopped and drained of excess water
1 clove garlic, minced
1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
1 Tbsp fresh cilantro
1/2 tsp cumin

Place the chickpeas and onions in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a
steel blade. Add the parsley, cilantro, hot pepper, garlic, and cumin.
Process until blended but not pureed.

Sprinkle in the baking powder and 4 Tbsp of the flour, and pulse.  You
want to add enough bulgur or flour so that the dough forms a small ball and no
longer sticks to your hands. Turn into a bowl and refrigerate, covered, for
several hours.

In a small bowl mix all yogurt sauce ingredients.  Let sit in refrigerator for
30 minutes. Stir before serving.

Form the chickpea mixture into balls about the size of walnuts, or use a
falafel scoop, available in Middle-Eastern markets.

Heat 3 inches of oil to 375 degrees in a deep pot or wok and fry 1 ball to
test. If it falls apart, add a little flour. Then fry about 6 balls at once
for a few minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
Stuff half a pita with falafel balls, chopped tomatoes, onion, green pepper,
and pickled turnips. Drizzle with tahina thinned with water.
