Veggie Jambalaya

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1 medium green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 celery rib, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 cups slow-cooked or one 15.5-ounce can dark red kidney beans, drained
      and rinsed
1 1/2 cups slow-cooked or one 15.5-ounce can black-eyed peas, drained and rinsed
One 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes
One 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes, drained
1 cup water
1 teaspoon file powder (optional)
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme, crumbled
1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
8 ounces vegetarian sausage links, cut into 1-inch pieces
Tabasco sauce

Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the
onion, bell pepper, celery, and garlic; cover, and cook until softened,
about 5 minutes.

Transfer to a 4- to 6-quart slow cooker. Add the beans, tomatoes, water,
file powder (if using), thyme, and Old Bay seasoning; season with salt and
pepper, cover, and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours.

Just before serving time, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small
skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage link pieces and cook until browned,
then add to the jambalaya along with Tabasco sauce to taste.
