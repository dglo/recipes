Vegetarian Guinness Stew
serves 6

1 Tablespoon olive oil
3 celery stalks
3 (small) onions
1 lb. button mushrooms, cleaned
3 lb. russett potatoes, peeled
3 large carrots, peeled
1 Tablespoon flour
1 11.2-ounce bottle of Guinness
1 teaspoon mustard
1 Tablespoon Better than Bouillon vegetable base
2 Tablespoon tomato paste
1 bay leaf
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon paprika
4 cups water
2 teaspoons sugar
1 teaspoon salt

Finely chop celery, 2 of the onions and 4 mushrooms. Heat olive oil in a large
soup pot and add chopped vegetables. Cook until softened and beginning to
brown, about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, chop the remaining onion, potatoes and carrots into large chunks.
Set aside.

Add flour to the softened mixture and stir to coat. Cook for 2 minutes. Pour
in Guinness and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the
remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer uncovered
until all vegetables are fork-tender, about 45 minutes.
