Thai Chicken & Noodles

I used tamari for this recipe, rather than soy sauce.  I prefer using tamari,
as it's naturally processed, contains no MSG & has a more mellow, less salty
flavor.  But, you can certainly use soy sauce, if that's preferred.  The rice
noodles can be found in Asian markets, or in most specialty food shops.  If
needed, you can substitute spaghetti for the noodles.
Serves 4

1 1/4 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast {cut into thin slices}
4 scallions, thinly sliced {white & light green parts}
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup tamari {or soy sauce}
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 tablespoons light brown sugar
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice
1/2 teaspoon anchovy paste
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes {or, to taste}
3 1/2 ounces Chinese rice noodles
1 tablespoon canola oil
2 carrots, peeled & sliced into ribbons with a vegetable peeler
1/2 English cucumber, halved lengthwise & thinly sliced
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil leaves
optional toppings: chopped peanuts, sliced scallions, sliced limes, bean sprouts & red pepper flakes

Begin by making the marinade for the chicken.  Add the scallions, garlic,
tamari, rice vinegar, light brown sugar, lime juice, anchovy paste & red
pepper flakes to a mixing bowl.  Whisk to combine.  Place the chicken in a
storage container, or resealable plastic bag & add 1/2 the marinade {save the
remaining marinade to use for a sauce on the finished salad}.  Stir to coat all
the chicken, seal & chill for at least 30 minutes.  

Cook the noodles, according to the package instructions, drain & transfer to a
platter.

Add the oil to a large skillet & heat over medium-high heat.  Cook the chicken,
in batches, for about 1-2 minutes per side, or until cooked through & golden
brown.  

Transfer the chicken to the platter with the noodles & top with the carrots,
cucumber & basil.  Garnish with any of the optional toppings you desire &
serve with the remaining marinade on the side.
