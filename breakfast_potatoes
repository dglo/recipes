Breakfast Potatoes

Serves 2

1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon butter (or vegan substitute)
1 small onion, chopped
3 medium/large red potatoes, scrubbed, bad parts of skin and eyes removed,
  cut into 1/2" dice, about 2 1/2 cups
1/2 teaspoon salt, plus extra salt for the boiling water (about 1 teaspoon
    total)
1/8 - 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon fresh-cracked black pepper
1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped

Boil potatoes for 3 minutes in salted water. Drain potatoes and place back
into the same pot you just used to boil the potatoes. Place the pot back on
the burner, but make sure the burner is turned off. Note: the residual heat
will help the potatoes dry out.

Pre-heat a saute pan over medium heat. Add oil and butter and stir butter to
melt. Add onions and potatoes to the pan. Sprinkle mixture with salt, garlic
powder, paprika and pepper, and toss until well-coated and spices are evenly
distributed.

Spread mixture to an even layer and let brown on bottom, about 3-5 minutes.

Flip potatoes (it's ok if you don't flip every single piece over), spread to
an even layer and let brown, about 3-5 minutes.

If needed, toss again and continue cooking to desired doneness. (I didn't need
this step, but everyone likes their potatoes a little more or less crispy, so
just cook to your liking)

Stir in parsley just before serving.
