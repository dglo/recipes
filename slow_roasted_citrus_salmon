Samin Nosrat

Serves 4

Thinly sliced citrus fruit, like blood oranges, grapefruit, Meyer lemon,
   kumquats
1 (2-pound) King salmon filet, skin and pin bones removed
Kosher salt
1 tablespoon finely grated citrus
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat the oven to 225 degrees. Arrange citrus slices on a parchment-lined
baking sheet.

Season both sides of the salmon with salt. In a small bowl, mix together
grated citrus and olive oil. Rub it evenly over the salmon.

Place the salmon on top of the citrus and bake until fish begins to flake in
the thickest part when poked with a knife or finger, 40 to 50 minutes. Remove
from heat and let cool. Gently tear into bite-sized pieces.
