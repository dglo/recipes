Prep/cook Time: 20 min

1/2 cup quinoa speckled rice (1/3 cup of basmati rice + 5 tsp quinoa)
6 oz broccoli florets, roughly chopped
4 oz coleslaw blend
4 mini sweet peppers, trimmed and sliced into rounds

2 tsp togarashi (or red pepper flakes)
6 tbsp gluten-free Thai peanut sauce (or hoisin sauce)
2 tsp olive oil
Salt

Combine rice, 1 cup water, and a pinch of salt in small saucepan. Bring to a
boil, cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until water is absorbed and grains
are tender, 15 to 18 minutes.

Combine broccoli, coleslaw, peppers, vinegar, togarashi, 2 tsp olive oil, and
a pinch of salt in medium bowl and toss to combine. Divide rice and broccoli
salad between 2 bowls and drizzle with Thai peanut sauce.
