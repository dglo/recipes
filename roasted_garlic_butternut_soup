Prep time: 15 mins
Cook time: 50 mins
Serves: 4-6

1 butternut squash (about 2.5 lbs/1200g)
1 bulb garlic
Olive oil
1 liter broth (vegetable for vegan/vegetarian versions, beef for carnivore version)
Thyme
Salt
Pepper

Pre-heat oven to 400F (200C).

Peel and deseed butternut squash and dice into 1" pieces.

Put butternut squash on a baking sheet, sprinkle with salt and pour about a
tablespoon of olive oil on it and move around with your hands to make sure all
dice are well coated with oil. Then spread out evenly into one layer.

Peel off the paper-like outer layer of the garlic bulb, leaving intact the skins
of the individual cloves and being careful to keep the bulb as a whole.

Cut the top part of the garlic in order to expose the upper part of every clove

Drizzle a few drops of olive oil onto each clove.

Wrap garlic bulb in aluminum foil.

Put butternut squash and garlic in the oven for about 40 minutes or until soft
and golden.

Take out from the oven and transfer into a pot, add broth, 1 teaspoon very
finely chopped fresh Thyme and bring to the boil.

Once hot, remove from heat and blend with an immersion blender until smooth.
Add more broth or water if needed to reach desired consistency.

Salt and pepper to taste.

Top with a little pepper and a string of thyme.
