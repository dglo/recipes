Prep Time: 10 min
Cook Time: 45 min
Servings 4

1/3 medium yellow or white onion diced
1 sweet potato diced (about 1/3 pound)
1/3 tsp sea salt + more to taste
1/3 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp black pepper
1 Tbsp chili powder
1 tsp cumin
1.5 cups low sodium vegetable broth divided
1/3 cup quinoa uncooked and rinsed as needed
5 oz kidney beans drained and rinsed
5 oz black beans drained and rinsed
1/2 cup corn kernels frozen or canned and drained
1/3 cinnamon stick optional
Optional for serving:
lime juice, avocado, fresh cilantro, sour cream and/or cheese, as preferred,
and plenty of corn bread

In a large pot over medium heat, saut√© diced onion in about 2 teaspoons oil
until translucent and soft. Add diced sweet potato and spices (all are
optional). Cover and cook for 5 minutes.

Add 1 cup vegetable broth and bring mixture to a low boil on medium high heat,
then lower heat to medium-low and simmer. Add quinoa, beans, corn and cinnamon
stick; cover and cook for 30 minutes more and until the sweet potatoes are
fork tender and the chili is thick. Once chili is done cooking, stir in
additional vegetable broth. Taste and add more seasonings as needed.

(This can also be made in the crockpot: Add all ingredients to pot, then cook
on low for 4-5 hours or on high for 2-3 hours)

As with all chili and soup recipes, this is best when prepared the night before
or has time to sit before serving for a few hours so the flavors can really
shine.

Remove cinnamon stick and serve with fresh cilantro, lime juice,
avocado slices, guacamole, chips, sour cream and/or cheese, as preferred.

Reheat on medium heat on the stovetop. You will most likely need to add more
liquid to the chili because the quinoa will absorb the liquid.
