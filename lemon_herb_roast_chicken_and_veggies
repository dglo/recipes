Total: 1 hr
Prep: 15 min
Cook: 45 min
Yield: 4 servings

1 pound small red-skinned potatoes, quartered
2 medium carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces
2 stalks celery, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
1 medium red onion, cut into 1/2-inch wedges
2 teaspoons olive oil
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (about 1 3/4 pounds)
1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1 lemon, halved
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Adjust the oven rack to the top position and preheat to 450 degrees F. Toss
together the potatoes, carrots, celery, onions, 1 teaspoon of the olive oil,
1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper on a rimmed baking sheet and
arrange in a single layer. Roast until the vegetables brown slightly and the
potatoes just begin to soften, about 20 minutes, tossing halfway through.

Meanwhile, rub the chicken breast skin with the remaining 1 teaspoon oil and
sprinkle with the poultry seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Once the vegetables
begin to soften, put the chicken breasts on top and roast until the skin is
golden brown and the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F,
20 to 25 minutes.

Remove the chicken breasts and let them rest for a few minutes. Toss the
roasted vegetables with juice from 1 of the lemon halves and the parsley. Cut
the bones from the chicken breasts and slice the meat. Divide the chicken and
roasted vegetables among 4 plates. Cut the remaining lemon half into wedges
and serve alongside.
