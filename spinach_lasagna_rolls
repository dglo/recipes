Spinach Lasagna Rolls

9 lasagna noodles, cooked 
1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and completely drained 
1 (15 ounce) container fat free ricotta cheese 
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
1 egg 
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon dried Italian seasonings
salt and fresh pepper 
(optional) 1 chicken breast, cooked and diced 
32 oz tomato sauce (I used spaghetti sauce)
9 Tablespoons part skim mozzarella cheese, shredded 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Make sure you drain the spinach well. Combine
spinach, ricotta, Parmesan cheese, egg, garlic, Italian seasonings, chicken,
and salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Pour about 1 cup sauce on the bottom of
a 9 x 13 baking dish.

Place a piece of wax paper on the counter and lay out lasagna noodles. Make
sure noodles are dry by patting them with a paper towel. Take 1/3 cup of
ricotta mixture and spread evenly over a noodle. Roll carefully and place seam
side down onto the baking dish. Repeat with remaining noodles.

Ladle sauce over the noodles in the baking dish and top each one with 1 Tbsp
of mozzarella cheese. Cover baking dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake
for 40 minutes, or until cheese melts. Makes 9 rolls.

To serve, ladle a little sauce on the plate and top with lasagna roll.
