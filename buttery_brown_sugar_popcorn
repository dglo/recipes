http://dineanddish.net/2012/01/happy-national-popcorn-day-recipe-buttery-brown-sugar-popcorn/

1 cup unpopped popcorn
1/4 cup butter, melted
1 Tablespoon Kosher salt
1/4 cup brown sugar

Preheat oven to 250F
Pop un-popped popcorn
Pour popped popcorn onto a parchment lined baking sheet.
In the meantime, melt the butter in the skillet. Pour melted butter onto the
baking sheet over the popped popcorn. Stir until evenly distributed.
Sprinkle salt and brown sugar over the popcorn. Bake for 10 minutes. (Baking
isn't totally necessary, but it helps the brown sugar, butter mixture adhere
to the popcorn better). Pour into a big bowl and enjoy!
