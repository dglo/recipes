8 slices raisin walnut bread
8 oz. mozzarella
2 bulbs garlic
1/2 c. blue cheese
2 thyme stems
1/2 c. olive oil
salt & pepper

Pre-heat oven at 300 F. Peel the garlic and place the cloves in a 4 inch
round baking dish. Season with salt, black pepper and add thyme.

Cover tight with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Take the dish out of the oven,
add the blue cheese, cover and bake for extra 15 minutes or 'til the garlic is
tender.

Discard thyme, strain out the oil (tip: the olive oil will be amazingly
flavored and can be used in different preparations; don't discard it!) Smash
garlic and cheese into a paste.

Spread the paste in one slice of bread, cover with a handful of mozzarella,
top with another slice of bread and grill in both sides 'til cheese is melted
and bread is crispy and golden brown. Enjoy with a beer!
