Cashew Tofu
Serves 4

2 cups cooked tofu
1 tbsp olive oil
1 1/2 tsp minced garlic (about 3 cloves)
1 cup cashews
3/4 cup water
2 tbsp corn starch
2 tbsp white wine vinegar
4 tbsp Hoisin sauce
Low sodium soy sauce, to taste
1-2 cups broccoli florets
1 orange bell pepper, sliced
4 oz button mushrooms, sliced
3 green onions, green & white parts sliced

In a small bowl, whisk the water and corn starch together, set aside

Heat the oil in a large wok or skillet.  Add the garlic and cashews and cook
for 1 minute.  Add in the tofu, followed by the corn starch mixture.  Stir to
coat the tofu and add in the Hoisin sauce and white wine vinegar.  Stir and
simmer over low heat for 5 minutes or until the sauce has thickened.

Meanwhile, heat another tablespoon of oil in a second wok or skillet.  Add in
the mushroom and bell pepper.  Saute for about 5 minutes.  Add in the broccoli
florets and cook for another 3 minutes.

Remove the tofu mixture and the vegetable mixture from the heat and stir
together in a large serving bowl.  Garnish with green onions.  Serve over rice
with soy sauce to taste.
