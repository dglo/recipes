Ingredients
4 sheets aluminum foil, wrap (12-inch by 18-inch)
4 (5 ounce)  salmon fillets
1 lb asparagus
1 fresh lemon
fresh ground black pepper
seasoning salt
lemon wedge (to garnish)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.
Snap the ends off asparagus spears (they will break where tender) and divide
into 4 equal portions.
Spray the center of each foil sheet with non-stick cooking spray.
Place one salmon fillet in the center of each sheet, top with a serving of the
asparagus and drizzle with lemon juice.
Sprinkle with fresh ground pepper and salt or seasoning blend as desired.
Bring up the sides of foil and fold top over twice.
Seal ends, leaving room for air to circulate inside the packet.
Place packets on a cookie sheet and cook in oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until
salmon is opaque.
Serve with lemon wedges on the side.
Please use caution when opening the foil packs, as the steam is very hot.
