Ingredients

1/2 cup (1 stick or 115g) salted butter, softened to room temperature*
1/2 cup (100g) packed light brown sugar
1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
1 large egg
3/4 cup (185g) creamy peanut butter
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 and 1/4 cups (156g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
1 and 1/2 cups (300g) mini M&Ms

In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or stand mixer with paddle attachment,
cream the butter and sugars together on medium speed. Mix in the peanut butter,
egg, and vanilla (in that order). Slowly mix in the baking soda and flour. Do
not overmix. Fold in the M&Ms with a wooden spoon. Chill the dough for at
least 1-2 hours and up to 3 days.

Preheat oven to 350 F (177 C). Drop chilled dough by scant tablespoonfuls onto
cookie sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. I pressed a
few M&Ms on top of the dough balls. Press the balls down (only slightly) since
they wonâ€™t spread much while baking. Bake for 11-12 minutes. Cookies will be
soft and may appear undone. They will firm up as they cool.

Allow to cool completely on a wire rack. Enjoy!
