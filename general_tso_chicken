General Tso's Chicken
adapted from Coup De Pouce Magazine
serves 4
total time: about 30 minutes

1/2 cup brown sugar
3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
3 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
3 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 cup water
3-4 tablespoons cornstarch
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon sesame oil
6-8 green onions chopped, plus more for serving
3 tablespoons fresh ginger, finely chopped or grated
hot pepper flakes (optional)
sesame seeds (optional)
hot rice, for serving

In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, hoisin sauce, rice wine vinegar,
ketchup, soy sauce and water. Set aside.

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil. Dredge the chicken in the cornstarch
and shake off any excess. Cook the chicken in the olive oil until browned.
Remove the chicken from the skillet and cover with foil to keep warm.

Using a paper towel, wipe the skillet clean. Add the sesame oil, green onions
and ginger. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the sauce mixture and
bring to a boil. Simmer mixture for 2 minutes, or until the sauce thickens a
bit. Add the chicken back into the skillet, toss to coat with sauce, and
continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through.

Serve garnished with green onions, hot pepper flakes (if desired) and sesame
seeds (if desired).
