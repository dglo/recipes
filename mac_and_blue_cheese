Mac and Blue
http://www.cookistry.com/2012/01/whole-foods-friday-mac-and-blue-and.html

2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons flour
1 cup milk
4 ounces Swiss cheese
4 ounces blue cheese (plus more for garnish)
1/2 pound dry noodles, cooked
Parsley for garnish (optional) 

Heat the butter in a large sauce pan. Add the flour, and cook, stirring, until the roux begins to brown slightly - just a very pale tan.

Add the milk and cook until the mixture thickens. Add the cheese and cook, stirring, until the cheese melts into the sauce. The blue cheese might not melt completely, but you don't want large chucks - small bits distributed through the sauce is fine.

Add the cooked noodles to the sauce and stir to coat. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the pasta cooking water or more milk, if you prefer.

Serve hot, and garnish with additional blue cheese and/or parsley, if desired.
