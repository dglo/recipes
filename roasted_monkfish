Magnificent Roasted Monkfish
Happy Days with the Naked Chef, p. 159

1 small jar of sun-dried tomatoes in oil
2 lg. handfuls of fresh basil
4 9x11 pieces of wax paper
olive oil
bacon
4 7oz monkfish tail fillets, trimmed
sea salt and fresh black pepper
mashed potatoes

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Place sun-dried tomatoes and half of tomato oil in a food processor
with basil and blend until smooth.  While blending, add remaining oil
to paste until it's nice and spreadable.  A dash of balsamic vinegar 
can also be added for flavor and texture.

Rub olive oil on each piece of wax paper and cover with 3 pieces of
bacon laid snugly next to each other.  Cover bacon with tomato basil
paste.  Place monkfish at one end, season and, using wax paper, fold
and roll up.

Remove wax paper and carefully move to an oiled baking tray or disk,
then roast for 15-20 minutes.

Slice and serve over mashed potates.
