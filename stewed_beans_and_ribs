Serves 4

8 St. Louisâ€“style pork ribs, cut into individual ribs (I request them from the
    wider end of the rack)
1 pound dried large beans. I love Greek gigantes in this, but butter beans or
    large limas, light or dark red kidney beans, or other larger runner beans
    work great. Smaller beans break down too much and become more like refried
    beans with no definition.
1 dried bay leaf
Salt and pepper

Note: If I have an onion or a couple of shallots hanging around, I chop them
coarsely and toss them in. If I want it a little punchier, I might add a
peeled garlic clove or two or a couple shakes of red pepper flakes, a twig or
two of thyme. I might fancy it up when serving with some fresh chopped herbs,
a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil, or add some croutons or buttered toasted
breadcrumbs for some textural interest. But the recipe works great just as is.

Put the beans, ribs, and any optional ingredients into a large heavy-bottomed
pot over medium high heat and add seven cups of water.

Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and let cook for 2 to 4 hours
(this will depend on the size of the beans and how old they are). You want the
ribs so tender that you can pull the bones out easily, removing them and
leaving the meat behind, and the beans creamy on the inside but mostly still
holding their shape.

Season to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper. Remove the bay leaf.

If you want your beans creamier, you can mash up about a cup of the beans with
a fork and then stir them back into the pot. Garnish however you like and
serve hot.
