Serves 6

1 lemon
2.75 lb chicken
5 1/2 tbsp butter, softened
1 garlic bulb, smashed
1 good-quality sourdough loaf
1 potato, sliced
1 bunch basil
1 bunch thyme
1 bunch tarragon
1.25 cups extra virgin olive oil

Preheat the oven to 400 F. Place the whole lemon inside the chicken. Combine
the butter and half the garlic, and slide under the skin on the breast and
thighs. Smooth the skin to spread the butter mixture.

Cut bread in half horizontally (set top half aside for other use). Slice the
potato and arrange in a roasting pan for the bread to sit on. Put the bread
onto the potato. Rip the herbs and scatter over the bread with the remaining
garlic. Drizzle with half the oil, and season.

Place the chicken on top of the bread. Drizzle the remaining oil over the
chicken, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

Roast the chicken for 30 minutes, then reduce the oven to 280 F and cook a
further 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and rest for 20 minutes.

Break up the chicken on the bone and cut the bread into slices. Squeeze the
cooked lemon over the chicken and bread to serve.
