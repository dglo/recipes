Creamy Four Cheese Macaroni

1/3 cup all-purpose flour 
2 2/3 cups 1% low-fat milk 
3/4 cup (3 ounces) shredded fontina or Swiss cheese 
1/2 cup (2 ounces) grated fresh Parmesan cheese 
1/2 cup (2 ounces) shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese 
3 ounces light processed cheese (such as Velveeta Light) 
6 cups cooked elbow macaroni (about 3 cups uncooked) 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
Cooking spray 
1/3 cup crushed onion melba toasts (about 12 pieces) 
1 tablespoon butter or stick margarine, softened 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Lightly spoon flour into a dry measuring cup; level with a knife. Place flour
in a large saucepan. Gradually add milk, stirring with a whisk until blended.
Cook over medium heat until thick (about 8 minutes), stirring constantly. Add
cheeses; cook 3 minutes or until cheese melts, stirring frequently. Remove
from heat; stir in macaroni and salt.

Spoon mixture into a 2-quart casserole coated with cooking spray. Combine
crushed toasts and butter in a small bowl; stir until well-blended. Sprinkle
over macaroni mixture. Bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes or until bubbly.
