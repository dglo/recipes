Serves: 4
Time: 30 minutes

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 yellow onion, chopped (about 1-1/4 cups)
1 3/4 cups chicken or vegetable stock or water
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup long-grain rice
1 (15.5-ounce) can black or pinto beans
Lime wedges or cilantro leaves, for garnish (optional)

In a large saucepan or Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid, warm the olive oil
over medium heat. Add onion and saut√© until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add
the stock, cover and bring to a boil.

Add the salt, rice and beans (including the liquid). Stir just to combine,
then cover.

Turn the heat down as low as it will go, then let simmer, undisturbed, for
18 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 4 minutes, then fluff with
a fork.

Season to taste with salt and pepper, then garnish with lime or cilantro as
you wish.
