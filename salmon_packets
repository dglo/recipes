BAKED FISH IN PACKETS
4 servings.

1 c. carrots, julienned
1 c. celery, julienned
1 c. red bell pepper, julienned
1/2 c. scallions, julienned
4 fish steaks, about 6 oz. each (salmon, halibut)
4 tsp. lemon juice
1 tsp. dried dill weed
1/4 tsp. salt
6 tbsp. (I Can't Believe It's Not Butter)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Cut four pieces of aluminum foil about 14 inches
long. Divide vegetables equally on each piece. Arrange fish over vegetables;
sprinkle with lemon juice, dill and salt. Dot with butter. Fold foil around
fish and vegetables, seal tightly. Arrange packets on baking sheet. Bake for
30 minutes or until fish tests done. When I am doing this dish for company,
I use Parchment paper to wrap the fish, as it goes right to the table and the
guests get a kick out of opening the packet.
