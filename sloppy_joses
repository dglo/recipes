Sloppy Joses
Prep time: 10 mins
Cook time: 30 mins
Serves: 4

1 tablespoon olive oil
1 cup diced onion
1 small jalapeno, seeds and ribs removed, diced
1 lb ground beef
10 oz enchilada sauce
1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
1 cup shredded pepperjack cheese
4 hamburger buns

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and
jalapeno and cook, stirring often, until softened, 5-7 minutes. Add in the
ground beef and cook, breaking it up as it cooks, until browned and cooked
through, about 8 minutes. Drain off any excess grease. Pour in the enchilada
sauce, reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Stir in
the cilantro.

Turn the oven on to broil. Place the bun bottoms on a baking sheet and lightly
toast. Top the buns with the meat mixture, then the cheese. Place the bun tops
on the baking sheet, cut side up (to toast) and place the baking sheet in the
oven. Broil just until the cheese is melted and the top of the buns are toasted.

Place the top of the buns on the mixture and serve.
