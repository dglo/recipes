Lemon Risotto
Adapted from a recipe by Giada De Laurentiis
Serves 4-6

Ingredients
3 c low-sodium chicken broth
3 tbsp olive oil
1.5 tbsp butter
2 lg shallots, diced (or half a medium onion, minced)
1.5 c Arborio rice
3/4 c dry white wine
3 tbsp grated Parmesan, plus 3 tablespoons
3 tbsp heavy cream (optional)
3/4 a lemon, zested and juiced (the best way to do this is to juice and zest
       1 whole lemon and use all but 1/4 of the juice and zest)
1 tsp kosher salt plus more to taste
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper

In a medium saucepan bring the broth and 1 cup water to a simmer. Cover the
broth and keep hot over low heat.

In a medium, heavy saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the
shallots or onion and saute until tender but not brown. Add the rice and stir
to coat with the oil. Add the wine and simmer until the wine has almost
completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Add a ladleful of simmering broth
and stir until almost completely absorbed, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking
the rice, adding the broth a ladleful at a time, stirring constantly and
allowing each addition of the broth to absorb before adding the next, until
the rice is tender but still firm to the bite and the mixture is creamy, at
least 20 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in the butter, 3 tablespoons of
Parmesan, heavy cream if using, the lemon zest and juice, and the salt and
pepper, plus more to taste if necessary.

Serve immediately with salmon and sprinkle with remaining parmesan.
