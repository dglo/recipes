Total Time: 45 mins

2 3-oz packets chicken-flavored ramen noodles, one flavor packet reserved
1/2 c chopped almonds
2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
2 tbsp rice vinegar
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
1 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce
1 tbsp honey
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1/4 head red cabbage, thinly sliced (2 cups)
1/4 head green cabbage, thinly sliced (2 cups)
5 green onions, thinly sliced
1 large carrot, shaved into ribbons using a vegetable peeler
1 tbsp sesame seeds, plus more for garnish
1 10.7-ounce can Mandarin oranges, drained
1 avocado, diced

Preheat oven to 400 degrees with a rack set in the middle. Break up ramen
noodles into 1" pieces and mix on a rimmed baking sheet with almonds. Toast
until golden, 6 to 8 minutes, stirring once. Let cool completely.

Whisk together olive oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, soy sauce, and honey in a
large bowl and season with salt and pepper. 

Add red and green cabbages, green onions, carrot, and sesame seeds. Let sit at
least 20 minutes and up to 4 hours in the refrigerator, tossing occasionally. 

Just before serving, fold in Mandarin oranges, avocado, cooled noodles and
almonds and toss to combine. 

Garnish with sesame seeds before serving.
