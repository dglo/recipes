Roasted Vegetable Soup 

Butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1-inch cubes (2 cups)
Carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks (1 cup)
Parsnips, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks (1 cup)
Celery, cut into 1-inch pieces (1 cup)
Celery root, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes (1 cup)
2-3 sprigs of fresh thyme
Olive oil
Salt & freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 cups vegetable broth
1 1/2 cups whole milk

Preheat oven to 425 degrees.  Place the cut vegetables on a baking sheet in a
single layer.  Add the sprigs of thyme to the vegetables.  Drizzle the
vegetables and thyme with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Toss well.  Bake for
25-35 minutes or until vegetables are tender, turning once with a metal
spatula.  Once the vegetables are done cooking, discard thyme sprigs.

In a blender combine vegetable broth, milk and roasted vegetables.  Blend
until smooth.  Add additional vegetable broth, milk or water to reach desired
consistency.  Taste and adjust seasonings.  Pour soup into a soup pot and heat
through.  Serve with grilled cheese on wheat (or any good crusty bread) for
dipping.
