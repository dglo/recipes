For the Mushroom Sauce:
5 cups (570g) button mushrooms, washed, dried, and quartered
2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil
12 sprigs thyme, divided
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 1/4 cups (450g) whole milk
1/2 onion (125g), peeled and roughly chopped
2 cloves (8g) garlic, smashed
2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter
3 tablespoons (25g) flour

For the Ground Beef:
1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil
1 pound (454g) 90% lean ground beef
1 small (250g) onion, diced
2 cloves (8g) garlic, finely minced
1 tablespoon (8g) all-purpose flour
3/4 cup (180ml) chicken stock, either homemade or low-sodium store-bought
3/4 cup (100g) frozen or fresh peas
3/4 cup (100g) frozen or fresh corn kernels
1/4 cup (30g) chopped parsley
1/4 cup (30g) chopped chives
1 tablespoon (15g) Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons (10ml) Worcestershire sauce

To Finish:
1 pound (454g) Tater Tots, frozen or homemade
Ketchup, for serving

For the Mushroom Sauce: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven
to 350째F (180째C). In a large bowl, toss mushrooms with olive oil and 6 sprigs
thyme, then season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spread
seasoned mushrooms on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake until deeply
browned, about 45 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs and increase oven temperature
to 375째F (190째C).

In a medium saucepot, combine roasted mushrooms with 6 remaining thyme sprigs,
milk, onion, and garlic and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and steep,
covered, for 1 hour. Strain, pressing gently on the solids.

Wipe out pot and return to stovetop. Melt butter over medium heat until
foaming subsides, then add flour and mix into a paste. Continue cooking until
raw flour smell is gone, about 5 minutes. Whisking constantly, add mushroom-
infused milk in a thin, steady stream, or in increments of a couple of
tablespoons at a time, whisking thoroughly and getting into all corners of
the pot to maintain a homogeneous texture. Sauce will initially become very
thick, then get very thin once all milk is added.

Heat, stirring, until sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken slightly,
about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring, until sauce is thick
enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 3 minutes. Season to taste
with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.

For the Ground Beef: In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add
ground beef and break up into crumbles with a whisk or potato masher. Cook
until well browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain off any excess fat, leaving only
about 1 tablespoon (15ml) in skillet along with meat.

Reduce heat to medium, add onion and garlic to ground meat, and cook for
about 2 minutes. Add flour and cook an additional minute, until blond. Add
chicken stock and simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes.

Remove from heat and finish ground beef mixture with peas, corn, parsley,
chives, Dijon, and Worcestershire. Season to taste with kosher salt and
freshly ground black pepper. Scrape meat mixture into a 2-quart baking dish.

To Finish: Top meat with mushroom sauce and arrange Tater Tots on top. Bake
for 30 minutes, or until Tater Tots are crispy and golden brown. Serve with
squiggles of ketchup.
