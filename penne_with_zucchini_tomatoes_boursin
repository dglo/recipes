1/4 cup olive oil, divided
1 lb. zucchini, quartered lengthwise and sliced about 1/2-inch thick
salt and pepper
1 lb. penne pasta
1 pint cherry tomatoes, quartered
1 (5.2 oz.) package Boursin Garlic and Fine Herbs cheese
1/2 cup chopped fresh basil

Adjust an oven rack 4 inches from broiler element and heat broiler to high.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with tinfoil and brush with 1 tablespoon of oil.
Toss zucchini in a large bowl with 1 tablespoon oil, season with salt and
pepper, then spread evenly onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.
Place in the oven and broil, stirring occasionally until lightly brown
around the edges but still firm in the center, 10-15 minutes.  Remove from
the oven and let cool slightly.

Meanwhile, bring 4-quarts of water to boil in a large pot.  Add the pasta
and 1 tablespoon of salt and cook, stirring occasionally until al dente.
Reserve 1 cup of cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to the pot.

Add the tomatoes, Boursin cheese, and 1/4 cup reserved cooking water to
the pasta and toss well to combine.  Carefully stir in the zucchini, basil
and remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper to
taste and add remaining cooking water as needed to adjust consistency.
Serve with additional chopped basil if desired.
