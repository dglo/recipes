2 Tbsp olive oil, divided
1/2 lb. zucchini, quartered lengthwise and sliced about 1/2-inch thick
salt and pepper
1/2 lb. penne pasta
1 cup cherry tomatoes, quartered
1/2 package Boursin Garlic and Fine Herbs cheese (half of 5.2 oz. pkg)
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil

Adjust an oven rack 4 inches from broiler element and heat broiler to high.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with tinfoil and brush with 1/2 tablespoon of oil.
Toss zucchini in a large bowl with 1/2 tablespoon oil, season with salt and
pepper, then spread evenly onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.
Place in the oven and broil, stirring occasionally until lightly brown
around the edges but still firm in the center, 10-15 minutes.  Remove from
the oven and let cool slightly.

Meanwhile, bring 4-quarts of water to boil in a large pot.  Add the pasta
and 1/2 tablespoon of salt and cook, stirring occasionally until al dente.
Reserve 1/2 cup of cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to the pot.

Add the tomatoes, Boursin cheese, and 2 Tbsp reserved cooking water to
the pasta and toss well to combine.  Carefully stir in the zucchini, basil
and remaining tablespoon olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper to
taste and add remaining cooking water as needed to adjust consistency.
Serve with additional chopped basil if desired.
