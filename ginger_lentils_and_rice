Shipa's Dal and Rice with Ginger and Green Chilies
Serves 4-5

1 cup yellow split peas (or toor dal)
1 cup brown basmati rice
1 tbsp canola oil
1 large yellow onion, chopped
6-8 cloves garlic, crushed and minced
5-6 green chilies, finely chopped
    (small, pinky-finger-sized; use few for a milder dish)
4" x 1" knob ginger, grated (about 3-4 tbsp)
6 cups water
salt to taste

Heat oil in a stock pot or large saucepan. 

Add the onion and saute until soft. 

One at a time, add garlic, chilies, and ginger, cooking for a minute or two
between each addition. 

When the onions are clear(ish) and fragrant, add the water, dal, and rice. 
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and cover. 

Cook for 40 minutes or until dal and rice is tender and water is absorbed.

Stir occasionally to avoid scorching. 

Allow to cool for a few minutes if you can wait that long.
