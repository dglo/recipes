Prep time: 20 minutes
Cook time: 4 hours, 30 minutes
Yield: Serves 6-8

2 Tbsp butter
2 pounds (900 g) well marbled chuck beef roast, cut into 2-inch pieces
Salt
2 cups chopped onion (about 1 large onion)
2 celery stalks, chopped
2 Tbsp tomato paste
1 pint (16 ounces, 475 ml) Guinness extra stout (make sure you use extra
        stout and not draught)
3 cups (700 ml) beef broth
2 large carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
3-4 parsnips, peeled and cut into chunks
1/2 pound (280 g) celery root, potatoes, or young turnips, peeled and
        cut into chunks
2 teaspoons dried thyme
Salt
4 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional)

Heat the butter in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Brown the beef in
the butter, starting with the fattiest pieces of meat, fat side down in the
pan. This will allow some beef fat to render out. Work in batches as to not
crowd the pan.

Sprinkle salt over the beef as it browns. Once browned on all sides, transfer
the beef pieces into the slow cooker.

Add the onions and celery to the pan in which you just browned the beef. Saute
the onions and celery until they begin to brown at the edges, about 5 minutes.

Add the tomato paste and mix well. Cook for a minute or two, then add a little
of the Guinness, enough to make it easier for you to scrape up any browned
bits at the bottom of the pan.

Transfer the celery and onions into the slow cooker.

Add the rest of the Guinness, the beef broth, root vegetables, and thyme to
the slow cooker. Add two teaspoons of salt.

Cover and cook on "high" for 4 hours, or "low" for 8 hours. When done, add
more salt to taste. If you want, sprinkle with fresh parsley to serve.

NOTE: If you use turnips, make sure you only use young turnips, which are
smaller and sweeter than regular turnips. Regular turnips can be quite bitter.
