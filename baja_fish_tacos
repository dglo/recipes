http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/02/spicy-cabbage-slaw-recipe.html

1 pint finely shredded white or savoy cabbage (about 1/4th small head)
1/4 cup finely grated carrot (about 1/4 medium)
1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion (about 1/4 small)
Kosher salt
3 Tbsp white vinegar
1 Tbsp sugar
1 allspice berries
1/2 jalapeno pepper

Combine cabbage, carrot, red onion, and 2 tablespoons kosher salt in a large
bowl. Massage salt into vegetables. Set aside. Combine vinegar, sugar,
allspice, pepper, and 1 cup water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over
medium-high heat. Pour boiling liquid over cabbage mixture, then place a paper
towel directly on top of surface, pressing down until it is saturated to keep
the cabbage submerged. Let rest at room temperature until cool. Transfer to a
sealed container and refrigerate until ready to use. Slaw will keep for about
2 weeks.
