Prep Time: 10 minutes
Cook time: 20 minutes
Yield: About 2 cups of nacho sauce, plenty for a party.

2 cups vegetable broth
2 heaping cups chopped cauliflower (use the stems, too; measure after chopping)
2 large cloves garlic or 3 small, roughly chopped
2 shakes vegetarian worcestershire sauce or tamari
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup nutritional yeast (found in the natural foods section)
2 tablespoons cornstarch or arrowroot starch
1/4 cup salsa (use your favorite, homemade or prepared)

In a medium sauce pot, bring the vegetable stock to a gentle boil, and add the
cauliflower, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and
cook until cauliflower is very tender (easily pierced with a knife), about 15
minutes.

Add the onion powder, chili powder, paprika, mustard, salt, nutritional yeast,
and starch into the cauliflower mixture and give a good stir. Pour into a
blender. Mix on low for a few seconds, then increase the speed to puree. (Make
sure you remove the plug thingy in the lid, and cover the hole with a thick
pad of paper towels. Hot ingredients tend to go volcano in a blender.)

When the mixture is very smooth, pour it back into the sauce pot, stir in the
salsa, and bring the sauce to a gentle boil once more. Reduce heat to low, and
stir until thickened. Taste, and add salt as needed.

Serve warmed with a side of tortilla chips.
