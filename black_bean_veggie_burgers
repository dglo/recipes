Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burgers

1 (16 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1/2 green bell pepper, cut into 2 inch pieces
1/2 onion, cut into wedges
3 cloves garlic, peeled
1 egg
2 tablespoons taco seasoning
1 tsp. Siracha or any other chili sauce
Salt and Pepper to taste
1/2 cup breakcrumbs

If grilling, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil a sheet
of aluminum foil. If baking, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C),
and lightly oil a baking sheet. If using George Foreman, heat up and spray
with pam.

In a medium bowl, mash black beans with a fork until thick and pasty.

In a food processor, finely chop bell pepper, onion, and garlic. Drain excess
water out of veggies, then stir into mashed beans.

In a small bowl, stir together egg, taco seasoning, salt and pepper.

Stir the egg mixture into the mashed beans. Mix in bread crumbs until the
mixture is sticky and holds together. Divide mixture into four patties.

If grilling, place patties on foil, and grill about 8 minutes on each side.
If baking, place patties on baking sheet, and bake about 10 minutes on each
side. If using Foreman grill for about 15 minutes.

Serve on a whole wheat bun, topped with lettuce, tomato, avocado, ketchup and
pepper jack cheese for marsh.
