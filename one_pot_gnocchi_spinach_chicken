Recipe type: main
Serves: 4

2 Tb salted butter
2 TB all purpose flour
1 1/2 cups whole milk
1 cup regular chicken broth
1/4 tsp nutmeg
4 cloves garlic, minced
kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
8 oz thinly sliced mushrooms (white or baby bellas are good.)
1 lb shredded rotisserie chicken
1 (17.5) oz package fresh potato gnocchi
2 cups baby spinach leaves
1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese

Preheat oven to 425F with rack on upper middle position.

In a deep/large and oven-proof skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add
flour and whisk constantly for 3 minutes until a smooth roux is formed. Whisk
in milk and chicken broth until incorporated. Simmer and whisk constantly until
slightly thickened, 5 minutes. Whisk in nutmeg plus kosher salt/ground pepper
to taste.

Add shredded chicken, mushrooms, gnocchi, and spinach to the mixture. Stir
gently until well coated through, 30 seconds. Sprinkle parmesan evenly over
the top and bake in oven about 15-20 minutes or until sauce is bubbly at
around the edges and gnocchi is tender. If desired, broil 2-3 minutes to
further brown the top.
