Roasted Butternut Chowder with Apples and "Bacon"
Serves 4, adapted from The Food Matters Cookbook

1 butternut or kabocha squash, peeled, seeded and cut (about 1 1/2 lb)
1 large onion, chopped
2 large apples, peeled, cored and chopped
4 tempeh bacon slices, chopped
2 tbsp minced garlic
salt and black pepper
1 tbsp chopped fresh sage
1/2 cup water
6 cups vegetable broth

Heat the oven to 400.  Spread the squash, onion, apples, bacon and garlic in a
deep roasting pan or on a baking sheet.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper, spray
with cooking spray.  Roast, stirring every now and then, until the squash,
onion, and apples are tender and browned and the bacon is crisp, about
45 minutes.

Remove the roasting pan from the oven.  Stir in the sage and water and scrape
up all the browned bits from the bottom.  Transfer the contents of the pan to
a large pot or Dutch oven and set it over medium heat.

Add the stock and cook, simmering partially covered, until the squash, onion,
and apples break apart and thicken and flavor the broth, about 25 minutes.
Taste, adjust the seasoning, and serve.
