Servings: 4

2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
2 tsp corn starch
1/2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground turmeric divided
3 tsp garam masala divided
1 1/2 tsp salt divided
2 Tbsp olive oil divided
1 medium head of cauliflower cut into florets
3 Tbsp unsalted butter
1 yellow onion finely chopped
3 garlic cloves minced
2 tsp freshly grated ginger or ground ginger
2 Tbsp tomato paste
1 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
Pinch of cayenne pepper optional
1 8-oz can tomato sauce
2 cups vegetable broth
1/2 cup heavy cream or full-fat canned coconut milk
Basmati rice for serving
Fresh cilantro and whole-milk Greek yogurt for garnish

Combine lemon juice, corn starch, cumin, and Â½ teaspoon each of turmeric,
garam masala, and salt in a large bowl. Set aside.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook
cauliflower, tossing occasionally, until browned in places and beginning to
soften, 7 to 8 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, and transfer cauliflower to
bowl with corn starch mixture and toss to coat. Return seasoned cauliflower to
skillet and cook another 7 to 8 minutes, until charred in spots and
crisp-tender. Transfer cauliflower to a bowl.

Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and butter to skillet. Add onions and cook until
translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir in garlic, ginger, and tomato paste; cook
2 minutes, until fragrant. Add remaining 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, 2 1/2 teaspoon
garam masala, and 1 teaspoon salt, along with paprika, cinnamon, and cayenne;
cook 1 minute. Add tomato sauce and broth; bring mixture to a boil. Reduce to
a simmer, stir in cream, and return cauliflower to skillet. Simmer mixture
uncovered until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and
serve over rice with a dollop of yogurt.

Note: Serve with chickpeas for added protein.
