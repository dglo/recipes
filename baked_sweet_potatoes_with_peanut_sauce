Baked Sweet Potatoes with West African-Style Peanut Sauce
Peanuts are integral to West African cooking. The nutty, spicy flavors in the
filling complement the sweet potato. Serve with grilled chicken and Broccolini.

Ingredients
6 medium sweet potatoes (about 3 pounds) 
1 teaspoon canola oil 
1/3 cup finely chopped onion 
1 tablespoon grated peeled fresh ginger 
2 garlic cloves, minced 
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 
1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander 
1/8 teaspoon ground red pepper 
3/4 cup water 
3/4 cup tomato sauce 
1/4 cup peanut butter 
1 teaspoon sugar 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 

Preparation
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
Pierce potatoes with a fork, and bake at 375 degrees for 1 hour or until
tender. Cool potatoes slightly.

Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-low heat. Add onion, ginger, and
garlic; cook 3 minutes. Add cumin, coriander, and pepper; cook 1 minute. Add
3/4 cup water and next 4 ingredients (through salt), stirring until smooth;
bring to a simmer. Cook 2 minutes or until thick.

Split potatoes lengthwise, cutting to, but not through, other side. Spoon about
1/4 cup sauce into each potato. Top each serving with 1 teaspoon cilantro.

Yield
6 servings (serving size: 1 stuffed potato)
