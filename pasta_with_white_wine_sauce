Yield: 4
Prep Time: 5 minutes
Cook Time: 10 minutes

300 g (10.5 oz) linguine
1 tablespoon olive oil
30 g (2 tablespoons) unsalted butter
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes
200 ml (1 cup) dry white wine
1 tbsp lemon juice (or juice from half a lemon)
50 g (1/2 cup) freshly grated parmesan
A handful fresh parsley
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Bring a large pot of water to a boil, salt it generously and cook the pasta
al dente according to the instructions on the package. Reserve 1-2 cups of
pasta water before draining.

Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large, deep pan and melt the butter in it. Add
the garlic and red chilli flakes and cook on medium heat for 1-2 minutes,
stirring often (be careful not to burn the garlic).

Add the white wine and cook for 5 minutes until you can no longer smell the
alcohol. Add the lemon juice and continue to simmer for another minute.

Transfer the cooked pasta to the pan and toss well. Add a splash of the
reserved pasta water if it looks too dry.

Stir in the grated parmesan and parsley, season to taste and serve immediately.
