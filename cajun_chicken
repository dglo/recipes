http://www.eatwell101.com/one-pan-cajun-chicken-recipe

3 chicken legs (3 thighs + 3 drumsticks)
4 lg potatoes, cut in quarters or halves
2 sm red onions, cut in quarters
5 cloves garlic, crushed
2 Tbsp Cajun spice mix
Salt and fresh ground black pepper
1 chicken bouillon cube, crumbled
3-4 Tbsp olive oil
1 scallion

Rinse the chicken under running water and pat dry with paper towel.

Add chicken, potatoes, garlic to a rimmed baking pan and sprinkle with salt,
ground pepper, crumbled bouillon cube and cajun spice mix. Drizzle with olive
oil and toss everything to coat well. Marinate in the refrigerator for 30
minutes. Meanwhile preheat your oven to 430 degrees F.

Place in the oven to mid-low level and bake for 25 minutes. Add red onions then
lower the oven to 360 degrees F and bake for 25 minutes more. Check for
doneness, if the potatoes and chicken thighs are soft and easily pierced with
a fork, they are ready. If the chicken and vegetables have not browned up as
much as you would like, just broil for 5 minutes, watching carefully not to
burn the chicken.

Remove from the oven and serve right away in the baking dish, sprinkled with
chopped scallion.
