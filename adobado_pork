Adobado Pork Tenderloin
From Cooking Light  

The Spanish term adobado refers to a dish that has been marinated and that
generally contains chiles. In this dish, anchos (AHN-chohs), dried poblano
chiles, are used to give the dish some mild heat. Serve with salsa and corn
tortillas. 

5 ancho chiles 
2 cups boiling water 
1 cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth 
2 tablespoons sugar 
3 tablespoons cider vinegar 
1 teaspoon dried oregano 
2 teaspoons olive oil 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
1/4 teaspoon black pepper 
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves 
4 large garlic cloves, halved 
2 pounds pork tenderloin 
 Cooking spray 

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add chiles;
cook 2 minutes, turning frequently. Remove from heat; cool. Discard stems and
seeds. Combine roasted chiles and boiling water in a bowl; cover and let stand
for 20 minutes or until soft. Drain well. Combine rehydrated chiles, broth,
and next 9 ingredients (broth through garlic) in a blender; process until
smooth. Cook chile paste in skillet over medium-low heat until very thick
(about 8 minutes), stirring frequently. Cool.

Trim fat from pork. Slice pork lengthwise, cutting to, but not through, other
side. Open halves, laying flat. Place pork in a 13 x 9-inch baking dish;
spread chile paste over all sides of pork. Cover and marinate in refrigerator
6 hours or overnight.

Prepare grill.

Remove pork from dish, reserving chile paste. Insert a meat thermometer into
the thickest part of pork. Place pork on a grill rack coated with cooking
spray; cook for 8 minutes on each side or until thermometer registers 160
(slightly pink), brushing with reserved chile paste frequently. 

Yield: 8 servings (serving size: 3 ounces pork)
