Kung Pao Chicken
Source: (C) Cooking Light Magazine
4 servings (serving size: about 1 c chicken mixture and 1 1/2 tsp peanuts)

This traditionally spicy Szechuan dish is nicely balanced by the menu's
slightly sweet cucumber salad. If you like fiery flavors, add up to one
teaspoon of crushed red pepper. Speed up dinner by using bottled ground
fresh ginger and bottled minced garlic. Total time: 30 minutes.

RECIPE INGREDIENTS

1 tablespoon canola oil, divided
4 cups broccoli florets
1 tablespoon ground fresh ginger (such as Spice World), divided
2 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1/4-inch strips
1/2 cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
1 teaspoon cornstarch
4 garlic cloves, minced
2 tablespoons coarsely chopped salted peanuts

RECIPE METHOD

Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add
broccoli and 2 teaspoons ginger to pan; saute 1 minute. Add water. Cover;
cook 2 minutes or until broccoli is crisp-tender. Remove broccoli from pan;
keep warm.

Heat remaining 2 teaspoons oil in pan; add remaining 1 teaspoon ginger,
crushed red pepper, and chicken. Cook 4 minutes or until chicken is lightly
browned, stirring frequently.

Combine broth and next 5 ingredients (through garlic) in a small bowl, and
stir with a whisk. Add broth mixture to pan; cook 1 minute or until mixture
thickens, stirring constantly. Return broccoli mixture to pan; toss to coat.
Sprinkle with peanuts.
