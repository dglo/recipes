Oven-Baked Acorn Squash Gratin
(serves 3-4)

1 acorn squash, oven baked and cooled
150g mushrooms, sliced
1 celery rib, chopped
1/2 red bell pepper, chopped
1/2 yellow bell pepper, chopped
1 small white turnip, cut into small cubes
1 tomato, diced
1 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp Sambal Oelek
1 tbsp dried oregano
1 tbsp fresh sage, chopped
1/4 cup pumpkin seeds
1/4 cup + 1/2 cup water
1/2 cup 0% fat Greek yogurt
60g swiss cheese
60g sharp cheddar

The previous day, or at least 4 hours prior to making this dish, bake your
acorn squash. First, preheat your oven to 375F. Then cut the squash in half,
remove the seeds, sprinkle the interior with salt and pepper and lay the
squash face down in a shallow baking dish or cookie sheet. Add about a cup of
water in the bottom of the pan and bake for approximately 45 minutes to an
hour, until the squash is tender. Allow to cool completely.

When squash is cold, scoop the flesh out with a large spoon, trying to get as
much as possible in one go, then scrape the skin to get the rest of the flesh.
Cut that into big chunks and set aside.

Set oven to 375F.

Coat a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium high heat. Cook
the mushrooms until they are nice and golden brown.

Add celery, bell peppers, white turnip, salt, pepper and dried oregano. Cook
until the vegetables start to wilt, about 3-4 minutes.

Add 1/4 cup of water, Sambal Oelek, fresh sage and tomato. Cook for a minute or
two, until water is evaporated.

Meanwhile, mix 1/2 cup of water and yogurt together in a small mixing bowl.

Add squash, pumpkin seeds and yogurt to the rest of the vegetables. Remove
from heat and stir delicately to combine, no more.

Transfer to oven safe individual baking dishes and sprinkle cheeses overtop.

Place in the oven and cook for 10-12 minutes, until the cheese is melted and
the mixture starts to bubble.

Set your oven to broil and leave for another 2-3 minutes, until the cheese is
nice and golden.
