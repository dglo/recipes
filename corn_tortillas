Homemade Corn Tortillas

Amounts will vary based on how many tortillas you want to make; I usually make
16 and follow the amounts listed on the back of the masa bag which are:

2 cups masa
1.25 cups water
1/4 teaspoon salt

Combine all ingredients to form large balls. Divide into 16 balls.
Lay a damp towel over dough balls so they don't dry out.
Heat a pan/skillet to medium-high heat.

If using a tortilla press:
* Open the press, rub several drops of water over both top and bottom surface
  and then place cling wrap on each side.
* Smooth the cling wrap, ensuring that it's well-adhered.
* Place a ball in the tortilla press, slightly back of center.
* Press down to completely flatten the ball, then slowly open up.
* Use a spatula to gently remove the tortilla and transfer to pan.

If using a rolling pin:
* Spread a few drops of water on the counter and then lay down some cling wrap,
  smoothing out the wrinkles and making sure it's well-adhered.
* Place your dough ball in the center and cover with another piece of cling
  wrap.
* Use rolling pin to flatten the ball into a tortilla.
* Remove the cling wrap and use a spatula to transfer the tortilla to a pan.

Note: As you progress through rolling out the dough balls, some may dry out.
Simply work a few drops of water into the dough ball.

Cook the tortilla for ~50 seconds on each side and remove. Repeat with
remaining tortillas. I usually have 2 tortillas cooking at once to save time.

Store your tortillas wrapped up in a cloth napkin either in a covered
container or ziplock bag.
