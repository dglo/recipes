Peanut Butter Bars
YIELD: 16 bars

For the crust:
1 1/2 cups chocolate cookie crumbs (like Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers)
2 tablespoons granulated sugar
1/3 cup unsalted butter

For the peanut butter layer:
1/2 cup unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar
1 cup smooth peanut butter
1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs

For the chocolate layer on top:
1/4 cup unsalted butter
3/4 cup 60% bittersweet chocolate, chopped

Preheat the oven to 350ยบ F. Line an 8x8" baking pan with parchment. In a small
bowl, mix together the cookie crumbs, 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, 1/3 cup
unsalted butter until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Press the crumbs into
the parchment-lined pan, packing down with the bottom of a glass. Bake for 15
minutes until set. Remove from oven and allow to cool.

Melt the 1/2 cup butter for the peanut butter layer. Mix in the powdered sugar
until smooth. Add in the peanut butter and whip until smooth. Stir in the
graham cracker crumbs. Spread the layer over the cooled crust. To avoid
breaking the crust, Drop several spoonfuls throughout the bottom of the crust
before smoothing the top.

In a double boiler melt the remaining 1/4 butter. Once melted, add in the
chocolate and stir until melted. Pour the chocolate over the peanut butter
layer. Refrigerate until firm. Cut into bars and serve.
