Roasted Pepper, Caper, and Mozzarella Pasta 

Serves 4-6 

6 bell peppers (if you can get a mix of colors, go for it)
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 clove garlic, minced
Salt, to taste
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons capers, drained
2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley, chopped (optional)
8 oz mini mozzarella balls (the fresh kind in the water)

1/2 lb pasta, cooked in salted water and drained 

Roast the peppers: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line peppers on a large
baking sheet and roast them for 45 minutes to 1 hour, using tongs to rotate
them 1/4 of the way, rotisserie-style, every 15 minutes. It's safer to extend
the cooking time than shorten it, as the skins will only come off easily if
they're fully cooked.

Once they're fully roasted, cover the pepper tray with another piece of foil
and let the peppers cool. When they're cool enough to handle, remove the skins.
Remove seeds and slice sections of pepper into 1/4-inch wide strips.

Toss peppers with red wine vinegar, garlic and a few pinches of salt. Cover
and let marinate for an hour or overnight (and up to 4 days) in the fridge.

Pour cooked pasta into a large bowl. Toss in pepper mixture. Adjust seasonings,
adding salt, freshly ground black pepper or additional vinegar, to taste.
Arrange mozzarella and capers on top and sprinkle with parsley.
