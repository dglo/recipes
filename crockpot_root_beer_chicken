Prep time:  10 mins
Cook time:  5 hours
Serves: 6-8

3-4 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1 cup barbecue sauce
1 cup root beer soda
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

Place chicken in bottom of a large slow cooker. Sprinkle with salt, garlic
powder, and pepper.

In a separate bowl, whisk together remaining ingredients.

Pour sauce over chicken.

Cover and cook on low for 5-6 hours. I like to remove the lid of my slow
cooker during the final hour of cooking to allow the sauce to thicken a bit.
