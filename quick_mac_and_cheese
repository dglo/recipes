Prep Time: 5 min
Cook Time: 10 min
Ready In: 15 min
2 servings

6 ounces pasta
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon flour
1/2 cup milk
3/4 cup cheddar cheese shredded
pinch salt and pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Prepare pasta according to box (or how you normally do it!)  Drain and set
aside.

In a small pan, heat butter over medium-low heat until melted.  Whisk in flour
and let cook for 1-2 minutes.  Whisk in milk, salt, pepper, and garlic.
Continue to whisk until the mixture begins to thicken (1-2 more minutes).
Once thickened, remove from oven and mix in cheese, continuing to whisk until
melted (if the cheese sauce seems too thick, add a little more milk.)  Stir
into pasta and serve

Great additions include broccoli, onions, squash (or any other type of
favorite vegetable you can think of!)
