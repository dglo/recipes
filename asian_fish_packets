Asian Fish in a Packet
Preparation and cooking time: 30 minutes.
 Serves 2.

2 firm fish fillets or steaks. (We use haddock, cod, or tilapia, 
but almost anything would do, including salmon.)
1 cup cooked rice
2 cups coarsely chopped bok choy
2-4 scallions, chopped
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
1 garlic clove, minced or pressed
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons dark sesame oil
chili oil (optional)

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

Take two 12x24-inch sheets of aluminum foil and fold each sheet of foil over
to make a double-thick square. Brush a little vegetable oil in the center of
each square. Rinse the fish and prepare all of the ingredients.

Spread half of the rice on the center of each foil square and then layer the
greens, fish, and scallions on top of the rice. In a small bowl, combine the
vegetable oil, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil , and a few drops of
optional chili oil. Pour half the sauce over each serving. Fold the foil into
airtight packets. Bake for 20 minutes. Carefully avoiding the steam (our
lawyer made us say that) open a packet and check that the fish is cooked.

To serve, carefully open the foil and transfer the contents to plates. Or you
can just place the foil packets on plates.
