2 Tablespoons olive oil
1 large red onion, finely diced
1 medium red bell pepper, finely diced
4 medium cloves garlic, minced
3 cups cooked black beans (2 15-ounce cans is fine)
1 15-ounce can whole or diced tomatoes with their juices
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
Salt and pepper, to taste
{For Serving}
12 taco-sized flour (or corn) tortillas
Pickled Red Onions
Guacamole or sliced avocado
Sliced green olives with pimentos
Chopped tomatoes
Shredded lettuce
Cilantro sauce or chopped fresh cliantro

Heat the olive oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, one minute more.
Stir in the beans, tomatoes (if using whole tomatoes, crush in your hands before adding), chili powder, and cumin, and bring to a boil. Partially cover, reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until juices have thickened and flavors have melded, about 15 minutes. Mixture should be quite thick so it won't escape from taco shells, but not bone-dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
To serve, place about 1/3 cup bean mixture in the center of a tortilla, and top with pickled onions, guacamole, olives, and cilantro. I like to put the toppings in small bowls on the table and let everyone help themselves. Kids like these tacos anyway, but it helps their enthusiasm level to have been a part of the process.
