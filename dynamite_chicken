Dynamite Chicken

Oil
3 to 3 1/2 pound chicken
1/2 c. cilantro leaves
4 garlic cloves
1 tsp. salt
2 tsp. New Mexican pure chile powder
3/4 c. salsa (chunky bottled salsa OK)
1/2 c. beer (preferably Mexican)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees

Coat a Dutch oven with oil.  Rinse chicken, remove innards,
and cut off any large pieces of fat or skin.  Blot chicken
dry with paper towels.

Combine cilantro, garlic, salt, and chile powder in a processor.
Chop to a coarse puree.  Rub 1 tablespoon of the mixture inside
chicken.  Gently work your fingers under skin of breast to
loosen, then rub more of the mixture under the skin over the
breast.  Rub remaining mixture over the bird.  Place chicken
breast up in Dutch oven.  Pour 1/2 cup salsa into the cavity
of the chicken, then pour remaining salsa over the bird.  Add
beer to pan, cover and bake for 1 hour.  Uncover and roast 10 to
15 minutes longer, basting chicken with pan juices a couple of
times.
