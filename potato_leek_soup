Creamy Potato-Leek Soup

2 large leeks, white and light green parts only, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 Tbsp (15 ml) extra virgin olive oil, preferably organic
5 large white or yellow potatoes, peeled and cut in chunks
4 cups (1 liter) vegetable broth or stock
1/3 cup (80 ml) old-fashioned rolled oats (not instant or quick-cook)
fine sea salt, to taste
2 cups (480 ml) unsweetened almond, soy or hemp milk

In a large pot or dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add the leeks
and garlic and saute until the leeks are translucent, 5-8 minutes.

Add the remaining ingredients except the almond milk and increase the heat to
medium high.  Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and
cook until the potatoes are very tender, 20-25 minutes.  Stir in the almond
milk. Allow to cool for about 5 minutes.

Puree the mixture with a hand blender or in a regular blender or food
processor, in batches if necessary (take care not to burn yourself on the hot
soup!).  Return the mixture to the pot and heat over low heat until warmed
through.  Serve with crusty bread.  Makes 6-8 servings.  May be frozen
(defrost overnight in the refrigerator, then heat gently before serving).
