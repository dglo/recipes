PREP TIME: 15 mins
COOK TIME: 6 hours
 
2 cups apple cider (or juice)
1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup brown sugar
1-1/2 tsp. cumin
1-1/2 tsp. paprika
1-1/2 tsp. garlic powder
1 tsp. kosher salt
1 tsp. cayenne pepper
1/2 tsp. ground black pepper
optional: 4 tbsp. of your favorite barbecue sauce
1 medium onion, divided into eighths
2-3 lbs. pork shoulder, all ties removed (I used a pork shoulder butt roast)
4-6 sandwich buns

Add all the ingredients, starting with the pork, fat-side-up, followed by the
rest of the ingredients. Turn the heat to Low. Cook for 6-7 hours, or until
pork is tender and easily falls apart with a fork.

Pull the pork into shreds using two forks. Take care to remove the pieces of
fat. Return the shredded pork to the sauce.

Serve pulled pork piled high on a sandwich bun or just by itself. Top with some
coleslaw if you'd like. It's really yummy!
