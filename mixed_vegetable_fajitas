Prep Time: 10 mins
Cook Time: 20 mins
 
8 corn or flour tortillas
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 bell peppers (red, yellow, orange, or green. Your choice!), sliced
1 red or yellow onion, thickly sliced
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
3/4 teaspoons cumin
1 1/4 teaspoons chili powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
8 oz mushrooms, sliced
3 cloves garlic, minced

Optional toppings:

Lime wedges
Cilantro, roughly chopped
Avocado, sliced
Refried Beans
Salsa
Hot sauce

Heat your oven to 350F (180C).
Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil, and pop them in the oven for 15-20 minutes
until heated through.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Toss in the peppers,
onions, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, and salt. Stir to keep anything
from burning. Cook for about 5 minutes until the veggies just being to soften. 

Add in the mushrooms and garlic and continue to cook for another 5-7 minutes
until everything is just cooked. Crank the heat for the last minute if you
want to get a real sizzle going on. Bring the skillet directly to the table
for added fun, and rest on something so it doesn't burn your table. Dig in!
