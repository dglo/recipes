1 cup (16 Tbsp) Kerrygold butter, cold and cut into cubes
2 cups white whole wheat flour
1/3 cup vanilla sugar
1/3 cup light brown sugar, lightly packed

through several stages: first dry, then crumbly, eventually coming together in
a ball, cleaning the sides of the bowl. Remove from stand mixer.

of your hands. You should be able to fit 12 of them per cookie sheet.
Bake for 13-15 minutes, then remove from oven and let sit on baking sheet for
2 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
Sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving, if so desired.
