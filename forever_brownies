Yield: 16 brownies
Active Time: 35 minutes
Total Time: 1 hour, plus time to cool and 1 hour for chilling

Butter for the pan
1/4 cup Dutch process cocoa powder (0.7 oz / 20g)
5 ounces (142g) semisweet chocolate (preferably 64 to 68% cacao),
    coarsely chopped
6 tablespoons unsalted butter (3 oz / 85g), cut into pieces
1/4 cup neutral oil, such as vegetable or grapeseed (2 oz / 56g)
1/2 cup granulated sugar (3.5 oz / 100g)
1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar (3.5 oz / 100g)
1 large egg (1.8 oz / 50g)
2 large egg yolks (1.1 oz / 32g)
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3/4 cup all-purpose flour (3.5 oz / 100g)
2 tablespoons malted milk powder (0.63 oz / 18g) (optional)
1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (0.11 oz / 3g)
6 ounces (170g) milk chocolate, coarsely chopped (1 cup)

Preheat the oven and prepare the pan: Arrange an oven rack in the center
position and preheat the oven to 350°F. Line an 8 × 8-inch pan with 2 sheets
of foil, crossing one over the other and pressing the foil into the corners
and up the sides. Lightly butter the foil and set aside.

Bloom the cocoa: In a large heatproof bowl, whisk the cocoa powder and 1/4 cup
boiling water (4 oz / 113g) until smooth (this will bring out the flavor of
the cocoa).

Melt the chocolate, butter, and oil: Add the semisweet chocolate, butter, and
oil to the bowl with the cocoa mixture and set it over a medium saucepan
filled with about 1 inch of simmering (not boiling) water (make sure the
bottom of the bowl isn’t touching the water). Warm the mixture gently,
stirring occasionally, until the chocolate and butter are melted and the
mixture is smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat and let cool until lukewarm.

Add the sugars and egg: Whisk the granulated and brown sugars into the
chocolate mixture. It will look grainy and you might see some of the fat start
to separate from the rest of the mixture, which is normal. Add the whole egg,
egg yolks, and vanilla and whisk vigorously until the mixture comes back
together and looks very thick, smooth, and glossy.

Add the dry ingredients: Add the flour, malted milk powder (if using), and
salt and whisk slowly until everything is combined, then whisk more vigorously
until the batter is very thick, a full 45 seconds.

Fold in the chocolate and bake: Add the milk chocolate to the batter and fold
with a flexible spatula to distribute. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan,
spreading in an even layer all the way to the corners.

Bake the brownies until the surface is shiny and puffed and the center is dry
to the touch but still soft when pressed, 25 to 30 minutes.

Cool, chill, and cut: Allow the brownies to cool in the pan until they are no
longer hot, about 1 hour, then refrigerate until the bottom of the pan feels
cold, about 1 hour longer (this results in a chewier texture). Use the ends of
the foil to lift the brownies out of the pan and transfer to a cutting board.
Slice the brownies into 16 squares. 

If you don’t have an 8 x 8-inch pan, double the recipe and bake these in a
13 × 9-inch. If doubling the recipe makes more than you need, freeze the rest!
