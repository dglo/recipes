This originally appeared as "15-minute Chocolate Walnut Fudge" in Cook's Illustrated, recipe by David Pazmino. I made a batch of it last year to give as gifts to the kids on my list, and it was so good and was met with such enthusiastic squealing (!) that I think I'm going to have to make it again this year...

Yield: 49 pieces

16 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped fine
2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped fine
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts

Note: Don't omit the walnuts, which are crucial to the fudge's texture.

Line bottom of an 8-inch square pan with foil, leaving 1-inch overhanging at
two opposite sides of pan. Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray.

Toss chocolates, baking soda and salt in medium heatproof bowl until baking
soda is evenly distributed. Stir in sweetened condensed milk and vanilla. Set
bowl over 4-quart saucepan containing 2 cups simmering water. Stir with rubber
spatula until chocolate is almost fully melted and few small pieces remain, 2
to 4 minutes.

Remove bowl from heat and continue to stir until chocolate is fully melted and
mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes. Stir in walnuts. Transfer fudge to
prepared pan and spread in even layer with spatula. Refrigerate until set,
about 2 hours. Remove fudge from pan using foil and cut into squares.
