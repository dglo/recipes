Penne with Vodka Sauce
Adapted from Food Network Magazine
Serves 4

Kosher salt
12 ounces whole-wheat penne
1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
2 shallots, minced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 cup vodka
2/3 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese, plus more for topping
Handful of fresh basil leaves, torn, plus more for topping

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the penne and cook as the
package directs. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, then drain the pasta. 

Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the
shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, 2-3
minutes. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, 30 seconds,
or until fragrant. 

Remove from the heat and stir in the vodka, tomatoes and salt to taste. Return
the skillet to medium heat and simmer, stirring often, until the alcohol cooks
off, about 7 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream and cook until the sauce
thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in the parmesan and basil. 

Add the pasta to the sauce and toss to combine, adding some of the reserved
cooking water to loosen, if needed. Season with salt. Serve topped with more
parmesan and basil.
