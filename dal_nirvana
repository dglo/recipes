ingredients:
1 cup dry lentils
6 ounces canned tomato puree
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 cup water
4 tablespoons butter

freshly ground black pepper
1/3 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro

Directions:
In a large sauce pan, add the lentils and fill with water to cover by 2 inches.
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes until the lentils open
and are tender. Drain the water from the lentils and return the lentils to the
pot. Stir the lentils around in the pot mashing some of them against the pot
to break open. Add the tomato puree, ginger, garlic, cayenne pepper, water,
butter, salt and pepper. Cook for 1 hour until the dal is thick. Make sure to
check the pot periodically to make sure the water does not cook out.

Stir in cream, garnish with minced cilantro.
