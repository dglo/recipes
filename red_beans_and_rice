Slow Cooker Red Beans and Rice

This is the ultimate in thriftiness and convenience - beans in a slow cooker.
The long, slow cooking time coaxes all the flavor from the sausage into the
beans for a mild yet full-flavored dish. You can also cook in on low heat for
8 hours. 

3 cups water 
1 cup dried red kidney beans 
1 cup chopped onion 
1 cup chopped green bell pepper 
3/4 cup chopped celery 
1 teaspoon dried thyme 
1 teaspoon paprika 
3/4 teaspoon ground red pepper 
1/2 teaspoon black pepper 
1/2 (14-ounce) package turkey, pork, and beef smoked sausage, thinly sliced (such as Healthy Choice) 
1 bay leaf 
5 garlic cloves, minced 

1/2 teaspoon salt 
3 cups hot cooked long-grain rice 
1/4 cup chopped green onions 

Combine first 12 ingredients in an electric slow cooker. Cover with lid; cook
on high heat for 5 hours. Discard bay leaf; stir in salt. Serve over rice;
sprinkle servings evenly with green onions. 

Yield: 4 servings (serving size: 1 cup bean mixture, 3/4 cup rice, and
1 tablespoon green onions)
