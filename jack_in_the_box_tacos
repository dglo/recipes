Prep Time: 10 min
Cook Time: 5 min
Yields 6

Corn Tortillas
3/4 lb ground Turkey
McCormick Cheesy Taco Seasoning Mix Packet
Weight Watchers Cheese Singles
Shredded Lettuce or Cabbage

Lay taco shells flat on a tin-foil lined cookie sheet.

Spray shells with vegetable oil and broil in oven on high for 2 minutes.

In a medium skillet, cook the turkey, breaking it down into tiny pieces until
it's no longer pink. Drain any fat and add the Cheesy Taco seasoning mix.

Turn the tortillas over so the browned side is now facing down.

Put a spoonful of the meat mixture on the tortilla and fold in half. Repeat
for all tacos.

Once you have them all filled, put back into the oven and broil for just a
minute or two, flip and broil a minute or two longer.

Once they are out of the oven, take your cheese slice and cut it on the
diagonal. Take one half of the cheese and put it into the taco (pointy side
facing out of the taco), and stuff with shredded lettuce {I used cabbage}.
