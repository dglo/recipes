Spicy Noodles With Asparagus and Broccoli

~15 ounces of soba noodles or whole wheat pasta*
2 cups chopped fresh broccoli
1 bunch of asparagus, cut in bite-sized pieces
1 cup shredded carrots
2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds (lightly toast them in a dry skillet or buy
       toasted seeds)
1/2 cup green onions, chopped
1/4 low sodium soy sauce*
1 tbsp chili garlic sauce (or other hot sauce or chili flakes, adjust amount
       based on desired spice level)
1 tbsp rice vinegar
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
2 tsp aji-mirin (rice wine), optional

Cook the noodles according to the package directions. In the last minute of
cooking, add the broccoli and asparagus to the pot. When finished cooking,
drain and rinse with cool water to stop the cooking and rinse away the starch
that makes the noodles stick together.

In a large bowl, toss the noodle mixture with the carrots, sesame seeds, and
green onions.

Make the sauce by whisking together the soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, rice
vinegar, sesame oil, and aji-mirin. Pour the sauce over the noodles and toss
well. Serve at room temperature or chilled.
