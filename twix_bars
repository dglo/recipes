Shortbread Crust:
100g or 2/3 cup Unsalted Butter, soft.
50g or 1/2 cup Sugar
150g or 1 cup + 2 tbsp All Purpose/Plain Flour

Caramel Filling:
200g or 2/3 cup Condensed Milk
150g or 2/3 cup Unsalted Butter
50g or 1/2 cup Sugar
50g or 3 tbsp Golden Syrup, can also use Honey or Maple Syrup

Chocolate Topping:
200g or 1 cup Chocolate Chips/Squares

Preheat oven to 350F/175C. Line an 8-inch square pan with parchment paper and
grease the sides with butter.

In a bowl, beat sugar and butter to form a smooth paste. Add flour and gently
mix it all together. Use your hands to knead and mop up all the crumbs.

Flatten crust inside pan and try to level it as much as you can. Bake for
20-25 minutes or until your crust is a light golden brown around the edges.
Let it cool in the pan.

While your crust is baking, start the caramel. Put all filling ingredients
into a saucepan and place on medium-high heat, stirring gently. Watch it
closely as you stir. If you see little brown slivers at the bottom of the pan,
stir them in vigorously and turn the heat down to a low-medium. Simmer it
gently until it reaches a deep, golden brown color. It should take around 15
minutes.

When ready, pour the caramel over the cooled biscuit crust and spread evenly
using an offset spatula or knife. Let this cool for at least an hour. You
don’t want the caramel to be warm or it’ll ruin your chocolate. Don’t cool in
the fridge or else you’ll end up with a hard mess.

Melt chocolate using microwave or double boiler and pour over cooled caramel
to finish off.

To serve, heat up a knife using hot water (make sure you dry it) or a
blowtorch. This will ensure you get a nice clean cut. Cut into whatever size
slices you want; I usually go for 1-inch squares.
