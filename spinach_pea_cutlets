Spinach and green peas cutlets
http://naivecookcooks.com/2013/01/07/healthy-indulgence/

3 boiled potatoes, mashed
1/3 cup green peas, thawed if frozen or fresh, boiled for few minutes
1+1/3 cup finely chopped baby spinach, boiled for few minutes and water drained
1/3 cup finely chopped coriander
salt to taste
1/2 tbsp ginger paste or more to taste
1/2 tbsp Green chilli paste or more to taste
1 tbsp Chaat masala (optional)
Oil to cook

In a bowl, mix up everything except oil with hands until you feel a smooth
mixture. Roll it into small balls and flatten them a bit.

Heat a skillet and add few drops of oil and move the oil around to coat the
skillet. Keep the flame low. Transfer 3-4 cutlets to the skillet at a time or
depending on the size of skillet. Let them cook for good 5-7 minutes. Check
the bottom. If it is nicely done, then flip them and repeat.

Serve them hot with ketchup.

P.S You can refrigerate the left over in an air tight container and cook them
the next day for breakfast or snacks. Don't keep them for too long as I
noticed the potatoes start separating and the mix doesn't hold too good.
