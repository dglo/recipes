chocolate peppermint brownies

155g unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups sugar
3 eggs
1/2 cup cocoa powder
1/2 cup plain flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla essence
2 cups icing sugar, sifted
1 tablespoon water
1 teaspoon peppermint extract
1/2 cup cream
250g dark or milk chocolate, chopped roughly

Preheat the oven to 170 degrees C. Line a small slice tin.

Melt butter and mix with the sugar. Add eggs one at a time and whisk. Stir in
the vanilla essence and mix to combine.

Add sifted cocoa, flour and salt and mix.  Pour into a tin and bake for 40â€“45
minutes or until dry and crackled on top and slightly squidgy in the middle.
Put on a wire rack and leave to cool.

For the peppermint icing, put the icing sugar in a mixing bowl.  Stir in the
water and peppermint extract.  Add a little extra water if necessary to have a
spreadable consistency.  Spoon over the cooled brownie and spread evenly with
a palette knife.  Pop in the fridge for half an hour to firm up.

Pour the cream into a small saucepan and warm over a low heat until it just
starts to bubble.  Take off the heat and tip in the chopped chocolate.  Leave
to sit for 30 seconds, or thereabouts, and then gently stir until the
chocolate is melted and you have a smooth ganache.  Pour over the brownie and
spread evenly with a palette knife.  Let the ganache set.  I put the whole
brownie slab in the fridge before slicing.  I also store the sliced brownie in
the fridge.
