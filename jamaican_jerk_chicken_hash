Jamaican Jerk Chicken Hash
Jerk chicken, a traditional dish of the Caribbean, almost always contains hot
peppers, thyme, and allspice. Our version is milder, but full of flavor.

Ingredients
1/4 cup chopped green onions 
2 tablespoons chopped peeled fresh ginger 
1 tablespoon chopped jalapeno pepper 
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice 
1 tablespoon dark rum 
1 tablespoon molasses 
1 teaspoon ground allspice 
1/2 teaspoon salt 
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 
2 garlic cloves, crushed 
8 skinned, boned chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds) 
3 cups (1/2-inch) cubed peeled baking potato (about 1 pound) 
2 teaspoons vegetable oil 
2/3 cup evaporated low-fat milk 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
 Chopped fresh parsley (optional) 

Preparation
Combine first 10 ingredients in a blender, and process until smooth. Combine
green onion mixture and chicken in a large zip-top plastic bag; seal and
marinate in refrigerator 24 hours, turning bag occasionally.
Place potato in a saucepan, and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat,
and simmer 15 minutes or until tender; drain. Cool.

Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and
marinade; cook 5 minutes on each side or until done. Remove chicken from pan;
chop. Add chicken, potato, milk, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to pan; cook for 5
minutes or until thoroughly heated, stirring occasionally. Garnish with
parsley, if desired.
