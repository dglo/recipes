Prep: 10 minutes
Cook: 30 minutes
Serves 2

1 cup frozen corn
15 oz can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 tsp taco seasoning
2 chicken breasts or 4 chicken tenders
salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup salsa or pico de gallo
1 cup shredded pepper jack cheese
cilantro, to garnish
sour cream, optional
avocado, mashed, optional
 
Pull off 4 sheets of heavy-duty tin foil (8-10 inches) and layer to create
2 packets. Lightly mist with cooking spray.

Stir together the corn, black beans, and taco seasoning. Divide between the 2
foil packets. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Place 1 chicken breast
or 2 chicken tenders in each packet. Top the chicken with salsa and shredded
cheese.

Bring the two longer edges of the foil together above the food. Fold the edges
down twice, creating the top seal. Press the side edges together and fold,
creating a secure packet.

Cook on hot coals, a gas grill, or in a 375F oven for 30 to 45 minutes until
chicken is cooked through

Top with fresh cilantro, sour cream, and avocado before serving.
