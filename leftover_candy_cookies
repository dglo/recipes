3 cups all-purpose flour
1 + 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
1 + 1/2 packed brown sugar 
1 cup granulated sugar
3 large eggs
1 + 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
3 cups chocolate candy bars, chopped (like kit-kats, peanut butter cups,
       snickers, milky way, m&m's)
2/3 cup walnuts, chopped

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.

In a medium bowl whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.

In a large bowl beat together butter and sugars at high speed until pale and
fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in eggs. Beat in vanilla. 

Beat in flour just until blended. Gently mix in candy bars and walnuts, batter
will be thick.

Scoop 1/4 cup batter for each cookie placing about 3 inches apart. Flatten
mounds into 3-inch rounds using moistened palm of your hand. Bake, 1 sheet at
a time, until golden, 10-14 minutes. Cool cookies on wire racks.
