Enchilada Lasagna
Serves 6

2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small zucchini, diced
4 green onions, sliced
1/2 cup diced green pepper
1/4 cup sliced green olives {mild ones, such as lindsey olives}
2 cups baby spinach, chopped
1 teaspoon cumin
salt & pepper, to taste
2 cups cooked, chopped rotisserie chicken
7.5 oz. black beans {1/2 can}
7 oz. salsa {1 small can}
1/2 bunch roughly chopped cilantro
1/2 lb. grated cheddar cheese
9 corn tortillas, sliced
2 cups mild green enchilada sauce
desired toppings: sour cream, tomatoes, avocado, lettuce, cilantro, lime juice

In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Saute zucchini, onion and
green peppers until they start to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in olives,
spinach, cumin, salt and pepper until spinach starts to wilt. Once spinach is
all wilted, remove from heat and stir in chicken, beans, salsa and cilantro.
This is the filling for the lasagna. Set aside.

Spray a baking dish with non-stick cooking spray. {A 9x9 glass baking dish
will be fine.} Spread 1/4 cup enchilada sauce across the bottom and place one
layer of corn tortilla strips over top. Sprinkle some cheese over top. Spread
half the chicken and veggie filling over the tortillas and cheese. Top with
more cheese, more tortilla strips and 3/4 cup enchilada sauce. Continue
layering the lasagna with more cheese, the last 1/2 of the filling, more
cheese, the remaining tortilla strips, 1 cup of enchilada sauce and the last
bit of cheese. Cover and bake at 350 degrees for 30-45 minutes. Remove from
oven and cool 10 minutes before cutting and serving. Top with avocados, sour
cream, avocados, tomatoes, etc.
