Pesto Tilapia

24 ounces tilapia fillets (four 6 oz pieces of fish)
4 tablespoons pesto sauce (I used Classico Original Basil Pesto)
3 tablespoons Italian seasoned breadcrumbs (I used whole wheat by 4C)
2 tablespoons parmesan cheese, grated
ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Cover a baking sheet with foil and coat with non-stick cooking spray.

Place fish fillets on baking sheet and sprinkle with black pepper.
No salt is needed as pesto and parmesan cheese are both pretty salty.

In a small bowl, combine pesto, breadcrumbs, and parmesan cheese
(hands or a fork will do).

Divide the topping evenly over the fish fillets, spreading with your
fingers and pressing into the fish.

Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees, then switch to broil to crisp up
the crust for the last 2-5 minutes.

Parmesan Grits

3 tablespoons unsalted butter
Kosher salt
1 cup stone-ground grits
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup low-fat milk
3/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (3 ounces)
Freshly ground pepper

In a medium saucepan, bring 3 1/2 cups of water to a boil with 1 tablespoon
of the butter. Add a generous pinch of salt and gradually whisk in the grits.
Cook over moderately low heat, whisking often, until the grits are thick and
just tender, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, in another medium saucepan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of
butter. Whisk in the flour, and when it is bubbling, gradually whisk in the
milk. Cook over moderate heat, whisking frequently, until thickened and no
floury taste remains, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the grated cheese and cook
until just melted, about 2 minutes.

Using a rubber spatula, fold the Parmesan sauce into the grits and season
with salt and pepper. Serve right away.
