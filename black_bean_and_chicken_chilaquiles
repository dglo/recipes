Black Bean and Chicken Chilaquiles
 
A traditional Mexican breakfast favorite, chilaquiles (chee-lah-KEE-lays) is a
saute of day-old tortilla strips, fresh tomato sauce, cream, and cheese. This
hearty version is baked. Refrigerate leftover chilaquiles in individual
containers with tight-fitting lids. To reheat, drizzle with a tablespoon of
water, and microwave just until thoroughly heated. Total time: 45 minutes. 


Cooking spray
1 cup thinly sliced onion
5 garlic cloves, minced
2 cups shredded cooked chicken breast
1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained
1 cup fat-free, less-sodium chicken broth
1 (7 3/4-ounce) can salsa de chile fresco (such as El Pato)
15 (6-inch) corn tortillas, cut into 1-inch strips
1 cup shredded queso blanco (about 4 ounces)

Preheat oven to 450.
Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Coat pan with cooking
spray. Add onion; saute 5 minutes or until lightly browned. Add garlic; saute
1 minute. Add chicken; cook 30 seconds. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl; stir
in beans. Add broth and salsa to pan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer
5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside.

Place half of tortilla strips in bottom of an 11 x 7-inch baking dish coated
with cooking spray. Layer half of chicken mixture over tortillas; top with
remaining tortillas and chicken mixture. Pour broth mixture evenly over chicken
mixture. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 450 for 10 minutes or until tortillas
are lightly browned and cheese is melted.
