Prep: 2 hrs
Cook: 1 hr
Yield: 2 Poppy Seed Rolls (4 servings)


Dough:
1 package yeast (active dry)
2 cups milk (warm)
8 cups flour (all-purpose)
3/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
5 large eggs (room temperature)
4 ounces butter (melted)
2 (12.5-ounce) cans/25 ounces poppy seed filling (or make your own, see below)

Filling:
1 pound poppy seeds (ground)
1 cup sugar
6 ounces butter (softened)
1 cup milk (hot)
1 tablespoon zest (lemon)

If making your own filling:
Grind the poppy seeds in a poppy seed grinder.  In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup
sugar, 6 ounces butter, 1 cup hot milk, and zest.  Beat well and set aside.


In a small heatproof bowl, dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup of the warm milk.

In the bowl of a stand mixer or a large bowl, combine flour, 3/4 cup sugar,
salt, and eggs. Add remaining 1 1/2 cups warm milk, 4 ounces butter and yeast
mixture.  With the paddle attachment, or by hand, beat until smooth. The dough
will be sticky at this point.

Scrape dough into a clean greased bowl. Sprinkle the top with a little flour
and cover. Let stand in a warm place for 1 hour or until double in size.

Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured surface. Divide dough in half and
shape each half into a rectangle.  Spread 1 can or half of the filling you made
on each rectangle of dough and roll up like a jelly roll. Turn ends under so
filling will not leak out.

Place on a parchment-lined or greased pan, cover and let rise again until
double in size.

Heat oven to 350 F. Brush tops of rolls with additional melted butter.
Bake 45 to 60 minutes or until rolls are golden brown.

Remove from oven and cool. Dust rolls with confectioners' sugar if desired.
