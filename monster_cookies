1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter
3/4 cup of granulated sugar
3/4 cup of packed brown sugar

1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
1 teaspoon of baking soda

METHOD
1 Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Beat the butter and peanut butter until light and
  fluffy. Add the sugars and beat at medium speed until well incorporated and
  fluffy.
2 Add the eggs and vanilla and beat for about 2 minutes on medium speed.
3 Add the baking soda and beat for 30 seconds. Be sure to scrape down the
sides and bottom to ensure all the butter is well incorporated.
4 Add the flour and salt, a bit at a time until incorporated but do not overmix.
5 Fold in the mix-ins for either the kid version or the adult version.
  OR split the dough in half and cut the mix-in ingredient measurements in
  half, for half adult cookies and half kid cookies.
6 Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and scoop on rounded spoonfuls of
  dough and bake for 10-12 minutes or until lightly golden bown. Be sure to
  let them cool on the baking sheet before you move them.

Makes about 3 dozen cookies.
