Prep Time: 5 minutes
Cook Time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 side servings

1 pound (16 ounces) green beans or haricots verts
2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
Scant 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large, rimmed baking
sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.

Wash and trim the rough ends off the green beans. Pat them very dry with clean
tea towels (wet green beans turn soggy in the oven).

Place the prepared green beans on your baking sheet. Drizzle the olive oil
over the beans and sprinkle the salt all over. Use your hands to toss until
all of the beans are lightly coated in oil. Arrange the green beans across the
pan in a single, even layer.

Roast for 14 to 16 minutes, undisturbed, until they are crisp-tender with some
golden, caramelized spots. (If using slender haricots verts, they may be ready
a couple of minutes earlier.)
