Saag Aloo (Indian Spinach and Potato Curry)

2 tbsp ghee or canola oil, plus more if needed
3 medium-sized Yukon Gold potatoes, cubed
1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
1/4 yellow onion, chopped
1-2 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapeno pepper, chopped finely
1 thumb-sized piece of ginger, grated (about 1 tbsp)
1 tsp garam masala
1 tsp turmeric
10 oz. spinach, washed and chopped
1/4 cup heavy cream plus 1/4 cup water OR 1 can coconut milk
Kosher salt to taste

In a large pot, heat ghee or oil over medium heat and add potatoes.  Fry until
golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes.  Add cumin seeds and
continue cooking until they're toasted and fragrant, another minute or so.
Add the next six ingredients and continue cooking for another few minutes,
until onion is translucent and soft, adding more ghee or oil if necessary.
Stir in spinach and cook until wilted.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the
cream and water, and continue cooking another 15-20 minutes, until the
spinach is soft.  Season to taste with kosher salt and serve with rice or naan
bread.

Serves about 4.
