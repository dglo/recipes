Yield: 1 (8- or 9-inch) round or square cake
Time: 1 hour

For the topping:
1/2 cup/110 grams packed light or dark brown sugar
1/4 cup/55 grams unsalted butter (1/2 stick), melted
1/4 cup/30 grams all-purpose flour
1/4 cup/20 grams old-fashioned oats
1 teaspoon ground spices (cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, nutmeg or a combination)
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt

For the Cake:

1 1/2 cups/190 grams all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/2 cup/115 grams unsalted butter (1 stick), at room temperature
1/2 cup/100 grams granulated sugar
2 large eggs
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2/3 cup/160 milliliters sour cream, yogurt or nondairy yogurt, buttermilk, crème fraîche, or milk acidified with 1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon grated lemon or orange zest (optional)
1/2 cup fresh, frozen and thawed, or canned fruit, such as blueberries, raspberries, cherries, grated apple or pear, chopped pineapple (optional)

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter an 8- or 9-inch square pan.

Preparing the topping: Add all the topping ingredients to a medium bowl. Use a
rubber spatula until they all start to clump together. Squish or roll the
mixture into mostly large crumbs with some smaller ones.

Prepare the cake: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder,
baking soda and salt until combined.

In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the
butter and sugar at medium speed until creamy and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Beat
in the eggs, one at a time, then beat in vanilla extract. Add half of the
flour mixture, then beat in the sour cream. Add the remaining flour, and mix,
just until incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl. Fold in the
zest and fruit, if using.

Pour the batter into the baking pan and top evenly with the crumbs. Bake for
45 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let the cake cool in the pan. It’ll be gone before you know it.
