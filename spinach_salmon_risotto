Spinach and Wild Salmon Risotto
http://livingtastefully.weebly.com/passions-to-pastry/friday-night-dinner-spinach-and-wild-salmon-risotto

6+ c of organic or homemade chicken broth
1 Tbsp butter
1 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 c finely diced onion
1/2 c white wine
1 1/2 c arborio rice
10 oz frozen spinach, thawed, and pureed in a food processor until smooth
3/4 to 1 c fresh or pre-cooked wild salmon cubed and all bones removed
freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Heat the chicken broth in a medium saucepan and keep warm over low heat.

In a large, heavy saucepan, over medium-low heat, melt the butter.  Add the
olive oil the diced onion.  Cook the onion until softened and translucent.
Add the arborio rice and stir until all of the grains of rice are covered in
the butter and oil.

Pour the wine into the pan and stir until the wine is absorbed by the rice.
Begin adding broth 1/2 cup at a time when almost all the broth has been
absorbed, stirring constantly.  The entire process will take about 20 minutes.
When the rice is almost done, stir in the pureed spinach.  If using raw salmon,
add it now.  If you have left-over, cooked salmon, add it just as you pull the
rice mixture off the heat.

Taste and add salt as needed.  Transfer the risotto to bowls and top with
freshly grated Parmesan.  Risotto is shown with my No-Knead Baguettes, recipe
here.
