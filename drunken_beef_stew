2 tbsp vegetable oil
2 lbs beef stew meat
3 c dry red wine (1 bottle)
3 cups beef stock
1/3 c flour
1.5 lbs baby red potatoes
1 medium white onion, chopped
1 large leek, chopped
2 large shallots, chopped
4 large carrots, peeled and chopped into large chunks
4 stalks celery, chopped
6 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
2 inch piece of ginger, grated
1/2 c tomato paste
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground pepper
1 tsp smoked paprika
1/2 tsp cayenne
1/2 tsp cumin
2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
2 tbsp cornstarch
2 tbsp water

Preheat oven to 300 degrees.

On medium high heat, add vegetable oil to large sautee pan.  Brown beef by
placing pieces of beef in large dutch oven or other bakable pot - don't crowd
the meat! Work in batches if necessary.  Turn beef until all sides are browned.
Remove beef from pan and place in large mixing bowl.

If needed, add another tablespoon of oil to pot then add onions, leeks and
shallots. Cook for 5 minutes. Stir often so they don't burn.  Add garlic to
onions and cook for 1 minute.  Remove and place onions/garlic mixture into
beef bowl.

Add tomato paste to pot and cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. This will
deepen the flavour of the tomato paste.  Add 1 cup of wine to pan and mix with
paste. Stir and get all the bits stuck on the bottom of the pan off of the
pan.  Bring to simmer.  Add the beef and onions back into the pan.

In a small bowl stir flour salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika, and cumin.
Sprinkle flour mixture over the beef and combine.  Add Worcestershire sauce,
ginger, 2 cups wine, and stock to the pot.  Bring the pot to a simmer.

Add carrots, potatoes, and celery.  Cover and place pot in oven.

Cook for 3 hours, until beef is incredibly tender.

If it is not thick enough, mix cornstarch with cold water in a small dish
until cornstarch is dissolved.  Add to stew and stir in.  Place back in oven
for another 15 minutes.
