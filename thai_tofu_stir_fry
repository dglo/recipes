Ingredients
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon water
2 teaspoons Southeast Asian fish sauce
4 teaspoons light brown sugar
3 tablespoons peanut oil
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon grated, peeled, fresh ginger
1/2 to 1 teaspoon red chile flakes
1 block tofu, cubed
1/2 medium red onion, cut in 1-inch dice
1 medium yellow pepper, seeded, cut in 1-inch dice
1 jalapeno chile, thinly sliced into rounds
2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved
3/4 cup torn fresh basil leaves
1/4 cup torn fresh mint leaves
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
Serving suggestion: Jasmine rice

Directions
In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, water, fish sauce, and sugar; set
aside.

Heat the oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
garlic, ginger, and chile flakes, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Add the tofu and stir-fry about 2 minutes. Transfer the tofu to a medium bowl
with a slotted spoon.

Add the onion, pepper, and chile to the skillet, and stir-fry until lightly
browned, about 2 minutes. Return the tofu to the pan along with the soy sauce
mixture. Bring to a boil, and stir-fry until the sauce glazes the tofu, about
1 minute more.

Add the tomatoes and stir until coated with sauce, about 15 seconds. Remove
pan from the heat, stir in the basil, mint, and lime juice. Transfer to a
serving dish, serve immediately.
