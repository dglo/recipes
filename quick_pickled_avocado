Quick-pickled Avocado

Under-ripened avocados can be quick-pickled by submerging them in a brine with equal parts
of water and white vinegar.  The diluted vinegar will soften the avocado in two hours or so,
leaving it pliable and fresh tasting, though vinegary.  It might be too tart for guacamole,
but could be used for slices on top of tacos.
