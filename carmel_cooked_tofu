Caramel-Cooked Tofu
Michael Natkin: Herbivoracious
Prep time: 20 minutes
Yield:1 (Servings)
Ingredients:

1/4 cup rice wine or dry sherry
2 tsp rice vinegar
1/4 cup soy sauce (use a wheat-free version for gluten-free)
1 tsp toasted sesame oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 tsp minced fresh ginger
1/2 cup sugar
1 lb extra-firm tofu, patted thoroughly dry and cut into 2 x 2x 1/3-inch pieces
2 T vegetable oil
1/2 cup thinly sliced white onion
4 or more dried small red chilies (optional)
5 scallions, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced

Whisk together the rice wine, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic,
ginger and sugar until the sugar dissolves.

Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over
high heat. Lay the tofu squares in the skillet in a single layer (or as close
to a single layer as possible). Fry until golden brown on one side, about 4
minutes.

Flip the tofu and immediately pour in the sauce; add the white onions and
chilies, if using. The sauce will sputter and begin to caramelize. Keep a
close eye on it, and move the tofu around a little bit to let the sauce get
under it. Continue cooking until the sauce has thickened and become a fairly
thick glaze coating the tofu, about 4 minutes more.

Serve immediately, topped with the scallions.
