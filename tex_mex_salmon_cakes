http://bevcooks.com/2012/01/tex-mex-salmon-cakes/

1 (15 oz) can salmon, drained (don't be scared!)
1 (4 oz) can green diced chiles
2 cups blue corn tortilla chips, crumbled in a plastic baggy
1 cup finely diced white or yellow onion
4 Tbs. vegetable oil, divided
1 cup cilantro, finely chopped
1 Tbs. cumin
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup frozen corn
10 oz baby spinach
1 roma tomato, diced
pinch of coarse salt and freshly ground pepper

Heat 1 Tbs. oil in a medium skillet over medium-high. Add the onion and saut√© until you see a little color, about 5 minutes. Remove from pan and toss into a large bowl.

To the bowl, add the salmon, crushed chips, cilantro, chiles, cumin and a small pinch of salt and pepper. Mix to combine.

Place the flour in a shallow dish.

With your hands, shape the mixture into 1-inch cakes. Dredge them through the flour, coating on both sides.

Heat the remaining oil in a medium skillet and (if needed, in batches) add the cakes to the skillet and brown them on both sides, about 6 minutes total.

Remove from pan and set aside.

In the meantime, wilt the spinach in another pan. Once it's starting to wilt, add the corn and diced tomato. The corn will heat through as the spinach finishes wilting. How many times can I say WILT? Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.

Serve the salmon cakes with the corn/spinach relish and get on it.
