Chicken Supreme
 
"My mother used to make this recipe when I was growing up, and later I
lightened it up. It isn't your typical bland chicken dish. It has a special
pizazz that makes it great for dinner parties." -Kristy Rea, Naples, Fla. 

1 cup fat-free sour cream
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon celery salt
1 teaspoon paprika
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
4 garlic cloves, minced
6 (4-ounce) skinned, boned chicken breast halves
3/4 cup dry breadcrumbs
Cooking spray
3 tablespoons reduced-calorie stick margarine, melted and divided
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley

Combine first 8 ingredients in a large zip-top plastic bag. Add chicken; seal
and marinate in refrigerator overnight. Remove chicken from bag; discard
marinade.

Preheat oven to 325.

Place breadcrumbs in a shallow dish. Dredge the chicken in breadcrumbs. Place
the chicken in a 13 x 9-inch baking dish coated with cooking spray. Drizzle
1 1/2 tablespoons margarine over chicken, and bake at 325 for 30 minutes. Pour
1 1/2 tablespoons margarine over chicken, and bake for an additional 15
minutes or until done. Sprinkle chicken with chopped parsley.
