45 min | 10 min prep

SERVES 4

4-6 cups swiss chard, stemmed, sliced (or spinach)
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 cups onions, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
10 cups potatoes, diced (about 4 large)
2 cups red bell peppers, diced
1 teaspoon fresh thyme (1/2 tsp. dried)
1 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)
2 tablespoons soy sauce
4 dashes hot sauce

Rinse greens. Blanch them in 1/2 cup boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, until
wilted. Drain. Set aside.

Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet. Saute the onions and garlic on medium
heat for 10 minutes, until onions are translucent. Add the diced potatoes,
spreading them evenly in the pan. Cover, and cook 5 minutes. Uncover and stir
well. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes more, until potatoes are browned and tender.

Now add the drained greens, bell peppers, thyme, and mushrooms, if using.
Cover and cook for 5-10 minutes, stirring often, until peppers are tender.
Stir in the soy sauce and hot sauce to taste. Serve immediately. Enjoy!
