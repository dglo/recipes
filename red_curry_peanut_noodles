Red Curry Peanut Noodles
Serves 6 to 8.

1 pound whole-wheat spaghetti
1 package extra firm tofu (approximately 19 ounces)
Vegetable oil
3/4 cup peanut butter (smooth or chunky)
1 lime, juiced
2 tablespoon red curry paste
2/3 cup chicken or vegetable broth
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons packed cilantro leaves
Kosher salt
1 red bell pepper, julienned
12 ounces shelled edamame, prepared according to package directions
2 scallions, white and green parts quartered and thinly sliced lengthwise
1 carrot, coarsely grated
1 cup mung bean sprouts (2 1/2 ounces)
1/3 cup salted, roasted peanuts, coarsely chopped
Lime wedges, for serving

In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the spaghetti until it is al dente. Drain the spaghetti and rinse under cold water until cool. Drain very well and set aside.

Cut the tofu into 1/2-inch cubes and lay on paper towels to absorb excess moisture. On medium-high heat, saute the tofu in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil for 2-3 minutes on each side to lightly sear the outside and heat the inside. Set aside.

Meanwhile, in a food processor, combine the peanut butter with the lime juice, red curry paste, stock, and 1/4 cup of the cilantro leaves and puree. Season the sauce with salt.

In a large bowl, toss the spaghetti with the peanut sauce, scallions, carrots, edamame, bean sprouts, tofu, and red bell pepper until well coated. Season with salt.

Transfer to bowls and sprinkle with the remaining cilantro leaves and the peanuts. Serve with lime wedges.
