Baked Spaghetti

This is an easy, yet very tasty spaghetti casserole, which reminds me of the
spaghetti they used to serve us in elementary school. I loved their
spaghetti! I normally only bought my lunch, but not on spaghetti day!

Italian-Style Garlic Bread

Italians prefer olive oil instead of butter with their bread. Using garlic
powder is preferable for this recipe. Fresh garlic can be overwhelming and
give the bread a bitter taste. The health benefits of using olive oil over
butter is definitely on the plus side, too!

1 loaf unsliced French or Italian bread
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Preheat oven to 425*F (220*C).
Cut bread into 1-inch slices without cutting through to the bottom of the loaf.
Mix the olive oil, parsley, and garlic powder. With a pastry brush, spread oil
mixture it all over, inside and the out of the loaf of bread.
Wrap in aluminum foil and bake for about 15 minutes or until heated through.
During the last 5 minutes of baking, open up the foil to crisp the bread.

Makes 12 to 16 servings.
