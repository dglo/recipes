Spicy Chicken Katsu Sandwiches
Makes 4

1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup chopped bread-and-butter pickles
2 Tbsp. plus 1/4 cup hot sauce, such as Crystal
1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
3 Tbsp. cayenne pepper
2 tsp. garlic powder
1 large egg
2 cups panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, lightly pounded to 1/2 thick
1/4 cup (or more) extra-virgin olive oil
8 slices milk bread
Shredded iceberg lettuce (for serving)

Recipe Preparation

Combine mayonnaise, pickles, and 2 Tbsp. hot sauce in a small bowl. Season
with salt; set aside.

Combine flour, cayenne, garlic powder, and remaining 1 tsp. salt in a medium
bowl. Whisk egg and remaining 1/4 cup hot sauce in another medium bowl. Place
panko on a large plate. Working one at a time, dip chicken into flour dredge,
turning to coat. Shake off any excess. Dip into egg mixture until coated,
shaking off excess. Dredge in panko, turning to coat. Transfer to a large
plate or a small rimmed baking sheet.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Working in 2
batches, cook chicken, reducing heat to medium if itâ€™s browning too quickly,
until golden and very crisp on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer
to a wire rack.

Spread reserved spicy mayo on one side of each slice of bread. Top with
chicken and shredded lettuce, then close up sandwiches.
