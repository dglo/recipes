Melt-in-your-mouth Brownie Cookies
Yields 30-32 cookies

1/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour plus 2 tablespoons
1/2 cup unrefined sugar 
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon instant coffee powder
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup dark chocolate chips
1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips
2 eggs

In the bowl of an electric mixer, add the sugar, espresso, eggs and vanilla and beat on high speed for about 5 minutes, until thick. 

While the eggs are whipping, place the butter, oil and dark chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler. Heat until the butter and chocolate melt. Combine until smooth.

Gently fold the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture. Add the flour and baking powder and carefully fold it in. Fold in the chocolate chips.

Let the batter rest for about 10 minutes until it thickens slightly. 

Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.

Drop the batter by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheets and bake until puffed and cracked, about 7 to 8 minutes. Cool on a wire rack before removing from the baking sheets.
