Servings: 2
Prep/cook Time: 25

1 oz ginger, peeled and minced
1 tbsp tamari
2 tbsp peanut butter
2 tbsp rice vinegar
2 tbsp sesame oil (divided)
1 tbsp chili garlic sauce (divided)
10 oz high-fiber ramen noodles
1/4 cup peanuts
6 oz gai lan, chopped into 1-inch pieces
4 oz green Swiss chard, thinly sliced
2 mini sweet peppers, thinly sliced
Salt and pepper*

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil for the noodles. Add ginger,
tamari, peanut butter, rice vinegar, just half the sesame oil, just half the
chili garlic sauce, and 1/4 cup hot water to a medium bowl and whisk the sesame
ginger sauce. TIPS: The sauce will not be completely smooth. Use more chili
garlic sauce if you prefer more spice.

Add ramen noodles to the boiling water and cook until al dente, 1 to 2 minutes.
Drain noodles and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process. Heat
remaining sesame oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add peanuts
and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook until nuts are toasted and fragrant, 1 to
3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer toasted peanuts to a small bowl,
leaving the oil in the skillet. TIP: When peanuts become fragrant, remove them
from the skillet. They will continue to toast slightly while off heat.

Return the skillet with sesame oil to high heat. Add gai lan, Swiss chard, and
a pinch of salt and pepper and cook until bright green and tender, 2 to 3
minutes.

Add cooked ramen noodles and sesame ginger sauce to the skillet with the
greens. Cook, tossing frequently, until evenly coated and warmed through,
1 to 3 minutes.

Divide the sesame ginger noodles with stir-fried greens between bowls. Top with
toasted peanuts and mini sweet peppers. Drizzle with remaining chili garlic
sauce. Bon appetit!
