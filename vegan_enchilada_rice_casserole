Serves 6

Enchilada Sauce
3 tablespoons olive oil
3 tablespoons flour
1 can (28oz) cubed tomato
chili powder, oregano, cumin, garlic powder to taste
1 tablespoon brown sugar
salt and pepper to taste

Casserole
2 cups rice
1 batch enchilada sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 onion, chopped
3 bell papers, cubed
1 can kidney beans
1 can corn
1 cup vegetable cream (I used soy cream)
salt, pepper, garlic powder, red paprika to taste
fresh parsley

Start cooking the rice. Heat the oven to 180°C.

Meanwhile make the enchilada sauce. In a sauce pot mix together oil and flour,
cook the mixture for about a minute. Add the tomatoes and the seasoning. Stir
occasionally and cook for about 5 minutes.

In a pan sauté the onion on olive oil. After a few minutes add the drained beans
and smashed them with the back of a spoon. You will get something like refried
beans. Add the bell peppers and season with salt and pepper.

Now mix together rice, sauce and vegetables. Transfer into a baking dish.

Sprinkle some corn over the rice. Mix the cream with some salt, garlic powder
and red paprika, and pour over the corn.

Bake for 20 minutes and serve sprinkled with fresh parsley.
