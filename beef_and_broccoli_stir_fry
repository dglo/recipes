Serves 4

1/3 cup soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil (I like to use toasted)
1 tablespoon honey
1 clove garlic, finely chopped or grated
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, finely chopped or grated
1 teaspoon cornstarch
1 teaspoon water
1 pound boneless sirloin, tri tip, flank or skirt steak -
      sliced into 2 x 1/2 inch strips
1 package (14 ounces) frozen or fresh broccoli florets
3 teaspoons vegetable oil

Whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, garlic and ginger.
Place the beef in a Ziploc bag (or glass bowl), pouring in half of the sauce
mixture to coat the beef.
Marinate for either 20 minutes on the counter or covered overnight in the fridge
Whisk the cornstarch and water together and add to the remaining sauce mixture.
Heat a wok or large saut√© pan over high heat, add 2 teaspoons oil and add the
beef. Cook for 4 minutes and remove beef to a clean bowl.
Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil to the pan and cook the broccoli for 2
minutes.
Add the beef back into the pan. Make a well in the center and pour in the sauce
Cook until the sauce is
thick and everything is heated through, about 2 minutes.
Serve over brown rice.
