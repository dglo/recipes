Serves: 4

2 tbsp vegetable oil

1 tbsp cumin seeds
1/2 tsp paprika

Heat oil in a dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Add onions and keep

paprika, turmeric, salt.

Stir in chicken and cook for 1 minute on each side.

NOTES

Serve on a bed of basmati rice, with naan or flatbread, or sandwiched in
lettuce wraps with rice.

* To make cashew paste: using a food processor, pulse cashews and 1.5 tbsp
water on high until a smooth consistency is achieved. As an alternative to
cashew paste, use 2 tbsp of cornstarch or whole wheat flour which may need to
be whisked into the curry.
