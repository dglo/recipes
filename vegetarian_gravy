The Best Vegetarian Gravy
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 30 minutes

8 cups good vegetable stock (or 7 cups stock and 1 cup good, dry white wine)
8 dried shiitake mushrooms
1/2 cup butter (to make it vegan, substitute a good olive oil)
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 Tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon Marmite
Salt and ground black pepper, to taste

Pour the vegetable stock into a medium pot. Rinse the shiitakes well and add
to the pot. Bring stock to a boil over high heat, then remove from heat and
let mushrooms steep for 30 minutes. Pour stock and mushrooms into large
spouted measuring cup or bowl, and wipe out the pot with a paper towel.

Add the butter to the empty pot and melt over medium-high heat. Add the flour
and cook, whisking, until it turns very lightly golden, about two minutes.
Pour in the stock with the mushrooms in a stream, whisking the whole time.
Add soy sauce, marmite, and a few grinds of pepper.

Bring stock back to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until
gravy is reduced by almost half, about 20 minutes. Taste for seasoning and
add salt and additional pepper if desired. Remove mushrooms before serving.
