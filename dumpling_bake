Red Curry Broth
1 can (13.5 fl oz / 400ml) coconut milk
1/4 cup water
2-3 tablespoons red curry paste (depending how spicy you like it)
2 tablespoons soy sauce - I've used low sodium
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
1 tablespoon honey or sugar
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 large garlic clove
1 small cube of ginger

Dumpling Bake
16-20 dumplings of choice - I've used frozen veggie dumplings
2 bok choy bulbs
1 zucchini or any vegetable of choice

White jasmine rice or noodles

Garnish ideas - sesame seeds, sliced green onions, cilantro/coriander,
    chilli crisp oil


In a large baking dish 12 x 8 inch (30 x 20 cm) in size, pour in the coconut
milk, red curry paste, soy sauce, vinegar, honey and sesame oil - whisk
together so there aren't any lumps of paste then grate in the garlic and
ginger.

Preheat oven to 400F / 200C. Chop the bok choy and slice the zucchini and add
them to the baking dish. Stir so that the veggies are covered in the broth

Place in frozen dumplings so they aren't overlapping and slightly press them
into the broth - the tops should still be visible. Spoon some of the broth
over the dumplings and cover the baking dish with aluminium foil

Bake for 20 minutes covered, then remove the foil and bake for another 5-10
minutes until the broth is nice and bubbly and the dumplings have a slight
crisp on the top

Add your garnish and serve up your delicious Dumpling Bake over a bed of white
jasmine rice or noodles and enjoy!
