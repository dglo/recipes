2 pounds of sirloin steak
3/4 package of egg noodles
2 T vegetable or canola oil (olive oil works here too)
2 T of unsalted butter (I use Plugra)
Pound of your favorite mushrooms sliced (I used button, cremini work great)
1/3 cup minced shallots
1-1/3 cup sour cream at room temp
1 T fresh dill (half that amount if using dried)
Salt and pepper

Slice steak into bite size chunks and season with salt and pepper.

Cook noodles according to package until al dente.

While noodles are cooking heat oil in a large skillet and brown the steak over
medium high heat for about 2 minutes until still rare.

Remove steak from pan to a plate.

Keeping drippings from meat in the pan, add 2 T of butter and mushrooms to pan,
cooking over medium high heat for 5 minutes or until lightly browned.

Add shallots and cook for an additional 2 minutes.

Remove pan from heat, add back the steak along with the sour cream and dill.

Return to stove, turning heat down to medium and cook, stirring constantly for
about 4 minutes or until sour cream is heated through.

Drain al dente noodles and add to the stroganoff mixture, stirring until well
combined.

Serve immediately, adding more fresh dill if desired.

Leftovers can be refrigerated and kept for up to three more days.
