Quick Egg Roll Dipping Sauce
http://allrecipes.com/recipe/150107/quick-egg-roll-dipping-sauce/

3 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons rice vinegar
1/8 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder

Whisk together soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, garlic powder, and
onion powder until smooth. Distribute in small dipping dishes.

If you want to make this into a teriyaki, just add 2 Tbsp bit of brown sugar
and then cook it over low heat, adding a tablespoon of cornstarch for a
thicker, glossier glaze-type sauce.
