total time: 30 min
Serves 2.

2 sheets aluminum foil, 12x24 inches
2 firm fish fillets (5-6 ounces), or 1 fillet (10-12 ounces) cut in half
1 small zucchini, thinly sliced
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
1/4 cup dry white wine
Dash of salt and ground black pepper
1 tablespoon chopped fresh marjoram or basil (or 1 teaspoon dried)
6 black olives, halved and pitted

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.

Take two 12x24-inch sheets of aluminum foil, and fold each sheet of foil over to make a double-thick square. Brush a little oil on the center part of the square. Rinse the fish and prepare all of the ingredients.

Spread half of following ingredients in the middle of each square in this order: zucchini, mushrooms, fish, and onion slices. Sprinkle with olive oil, lemon juice, wine, salt and black papper, and marjoram or basil. Top with the black olive halves. Fold the foil into airtight packets. Bake for 20 minutes

Carefully avoiding the steam that will be released, open a packet and check that the fish is cooked.

To serve, lift the fish and vegetables with a spatula or large spoon onto individual serving dishes and pour the liquid left in the foil over each serving.
