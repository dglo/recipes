Crispy Smashed Potatoes

Small Red Potatoes, rinsed clean - the amount to cook depends on how many you are serving & how small the potatoes are, so you will have to decide that yourself
Garlic Salt & Pepper Seasoning
Dried Dill, or use any herb you prefer (fresh or dried)
Olive Oil

Fill a large saucepan about halfway with water and place your potatoes in the pot.  Turn heat on high and bring to a boil, and cook until potatoes are fork tender - about 10 minutes, but you will need to keep testing them because they may need longer depending on their size.  Drizzle olive oil generously onto a cookie sheet, then place the boiled potatoes on.  Preheat oven to 425.  

With a fork or potato masher, gently press down on each potato until they break open - you don't want to completely smash them down, just apply enough pressure to break them open.  Brush olive oil with a pastry brush onto each potato (or you can just drizzle it on) , then sprinkle with the garlic salt & pepper seasoning to taste.  Lastly, sprinkle the dried dill on each potato.  Place cookie sheet in oven and bake for about 20 minutes, or until they are crispy and have a nice golden brown color to them.
