150 g Firm tofu
1/2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp honey
1 tsp soy sauce
1/2 tsp water
1/8 tsp salt
1/8 tsp pepper

Press most water out of tofu, but not too much or it might become crumbly.
Dice the tofu in squares, aprox 1 cm. In a bowl add olive oil, honey,
soy sauce, water, salt & pepper and whisk with a spoon until well combined.

Place the tofu in a skillet and add the sauce, stirring well to cover every
side of the cubes. Cook on medium for 5-10 minutes until golden brown.
