Prep time: 20 mins
Cook time: 4 hours
Total time: 4 hours 20 mins
Serves: 6

1 Tbsp. fresh ginger, grated
3 cloves garlic, crushed
1 c. crushed tomatoes
1 c. canned unsweetened coconut milk
1 Tbsp. cumin
1 Tbsp. garam masala
1 tsp. turmeric
1 tsp. coriander
1/2 tsp. cardamom
1/2 Tbsp. chili powder
1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite sized pieces
4 oz. fat free plain Greek yogurt
1 Tbsp. Cornstarch
Salt to taste
4 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro leaves

Combine the ginger, garlic , tomatoes, coconut milk, spices, and chicken in
your slow cooker. Cook on high for 4 hours, or low for 8 hours. Uncover and
let cool ten minutes.

Stir together the yogurt and cornstarch in a small bowl. Let it sit for 5
minutes to activate the thickeners. Stir a few spoonfuls of the warm Tikka
Masala sauce into the yogurt to bring the temperature up and prevent curdling.
Pour the yogurt mixture into the slow cooker, stir, then let thicken for 15
minutes. Taste and add salt as needed.

Serve over basmati rice with a sprinkling of cilantro leaves.
