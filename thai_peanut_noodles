Thai Noodles With Spicy Peanut Sauce

This is a recipe that I've tweaked and adjusted to yield a warm noodle
side-dish. It can also stand alone as a main dish. It's quick and easy and
full of flavor! I serve it with Chicken Satay. Leftovers are yummy hot or cold.

**Chili-Garlic sauce can be increased or decreased depending on how spicy
you like your dish.  As written, this recipe has some heat, but is still
edible for my toddler son.
