Servings: 4
Time: 30 minutes

2 tablespoons canola or other neutral oil
6 cups root vegetables, such as carrots, parsnips, sweet potatoes and/or
       turnips, cut into 1/4-inch slices and halved or quartered if large
       (about 2 pounds)
1 (1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
10 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
3/4 cup Chinese rice wine
6 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
2 dried chiles, like chiles de arbol, or 1/4 teaspoon red-pepper flakes
2 cups fresh basil leaves, torn if large

In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Add the
vegetables, ginger and garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, until
vegetables are crisp-tender and browned in spots, 7 to 10 minutes.

Lower the heat to medium and stir in the rice wine, soy sauce, sesame oil,
brown sugar and red-pepper flakes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the
vegetables are tender and the sauce has reduced, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove
from heat, and stir in the basil.
