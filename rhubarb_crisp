Yield: 6 to 8 servings

6 Tbsp cold butter, cut into small pieces, plus more for greasing pan
2-1/2 to 3 lb rhubarb, trimmed, tough strings removed, and cut into 1-1/4 inch
              pieces (about 5 to 6 cups)
1/4 cup white sugar
1 Tbsp orange or lemon juice
1 tsp orange or lemon zest, or granulated ginger
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 tsp cinnamon, or to taste
Pinch salt
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup pecans

Heat oven to 375 degrees. Grease an 8- or 9-inch square baking or gratin dish
with a little butter. Toss rhubarb with white sugar, orange or lemon juice and
zest or ginger, and spread in baking dish.

Put the 6 tablespoons butter in a food processor along with brown sugar, flour,
cinnamon and salt, and pulse for about 20 or 30 seconds, until it looks like
small peas and just begins to clump together. Add oats and pecans and pulse
just a few times to combine.

Crumble the topping over rhubarb and bake until golden and beginning to brown,
45 to 50 minutes.
