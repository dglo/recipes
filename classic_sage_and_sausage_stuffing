Active: 45 mins
Total: 2 hrs 30 mins
Serves: 10 to 14 servings

2 1/2 lbs (1.25kg) high-quality sandwich bread or soft Italian or French
          bread (about 2 loaves), cut into 3/4-inch dice (about 5 quarts)
8 tablespoons butter (1 stick; 4 ounces; 115g)
1 1/2 pounds (680g) sage sausage, removed from casing
1 large onion, finely chopped (about 12 ounces; 350g)
4 large ribs celery, finely chopped (about 12 ounces; 350g)
2 cloves garlic, minced or grated on a Microplane grater
1/4 cup minced fresh sage leaves (or 2 teaspoons dried sage leaves)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, if needed (see note)
1 quart low-sodium homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken or turkey stock
        (4 cups; 1L), divided
3 large eggs
1/4 cup minced parsley leaves, divided

Adjust oven racks to lower-middle and upper-middle positions. Preheat oven to
275°F (135°C). Spread bread evenly over 2 rimmed baking sheets. Stagger trays
on oven racks and bake until completely dried, about 50 minutes total,
rotating trays and stirring bread cubes several times during baking. Remove
from oven and allow to cool. Increase oven temperature to 350°F (180°C).

In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming
subsides (do not allow butter to brown), about 2 minutes. Add sausage and mash
with a stiff whisk or potato masher to break up into fine pieces (largest
pieces should be no bigger than 1/4 inch). Cook, stirring frequently, until
only a few bits of pink remain, about 8 minutes. Add onion, celery, garlic,
and sage and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, about
10 minutes. Remove from heat and add half of chicken stock.

Whisk remaining chicken stock, eggs, and 3 tablespoons parsley in a medium
bowl until homogeneous. Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, slowly pour
egg mixture into sausage mixture. Add bread cubes and fold gently until evenly
mixed.

Use part of stuffing to stuff turkey, if desired (see note). To cook remaining
stuffing, transfer to a buttered 9- by 13-inch rectangular baking dish (or
10- by 14-inch oval dish), cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake until an
instant-read thermometer reads 150°F (66°C) when inserted into center of dish,
about 45 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until golden brown and crisp
on top, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Remove from oven, let cool for 5 minutes,
sprinkle with remaining parsley, and serve.

The stuffing can be prepared through step 3 and placed in a buttered baking
dish a day in advance. Remove from the refrigerator and allow the stuffing to
come to room temperature for at least 1 hour before baking the next day.

How to Scale Down This Recipe

This recipe can be scaled down by half. Divide all ingredients by two; use
2 eggs instead of 3; use 1 rimmed baking sheet instead of two to dry the
bread; bake stuffing in a 10-inch cast iron or carbon steel skillet instead of
a 9- by 13-inch baking dish.
