Blackened Tilapia directions:

Create a spice blend by pouring paprika powder, salt, onion powder, white
pepper, black pepper, cayenne pepper, thyme, oregano, celery seed and garlic
powder into a jar with a lid. Shake them until they are blended.

Use the spice blend to coat the Tilapia fillets, and let them sit for 30
minutes in room temperature.

Slice the lemon into wedges.

Heat up a frying pan over high heat.

Pour the oil into the frying pan and place the Tilapia fillets in the pan when
the oil is so hot it is nearly smoking.

Fry the Tilapia fillets until the fillets look opaque and can be easily flaked
with a fork. This will usually take around 3 minutes per side.

Remove the Tilapia fillets and place each fillet on a slice of bread.

Pour the remaining content of the frying pan over the Tilapia fillets and the
bread, and squeeze lemon juice over the Blackened Tilapia from the lemon
wedges.

Enjoy the tasty Blackened Tilapia immediately.
