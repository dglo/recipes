Leek Fritters
serves 2-3

2 medium leeks, trimmed and washed
4 green onions, finely chopped
100ml olive oil
1 long red chili, deseeded and sliced
1/4 cup parsley leaves, finely chopped
1 tsp ground cumin
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 egg, separated
1 whole egg
100g plain flour
1 tbsp baking powder
100ml milk
30g unsalted butter, melted

Cut leeks into 2cm (1in) thick slices.  Saute the green onions and leeks
in a pan with half the oil on medium heat for 10 minutes, or until soft.
Transfer to a large bowl and add the chili, parsley, cumin, cinnamon,
turmeric, sugar and salt.  Allow to cool.

Whisk the egg white to soft peaks and fold it into the vegetables. 

In another bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, remaining egg yolk,
whole egg, milk and butter to for a batter. Gently mix it into the egg white
and vegetable mixture.

Put 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil into a large frying pan and place over
a medium heat.  Spoon about half of the vegetable mixture into the pan to make
4 large fritters. Fry them for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden and
crisp.  Remove to a plate lined with paper towel and keep warm. Add more oil
to the pan, if needed, and repeat with the remaining batter. This amount
should make about 8 fritters.

Serve warm with a squeeze of lemon or a sauce made by mixing Greek yoghurt,
parsley and garlic.
