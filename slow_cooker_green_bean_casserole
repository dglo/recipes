Servings: 10

1 cup canned fried onions, French's
3 tablespoons butter
10 ounces white or cremini mushrooms, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1 teaspoon pepper, divided
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cups low sodium chicken broth
1 1/4 cups heavy cream
2 pounds green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
3/4 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese

2 slices hearty white bread, torn into pieces
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
2 cups canned fried onions

Pulse 1 cup of fried onions in a food processor until finely ground. Set aside.

In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat and add mushrooms and saute
until mushrooms release their liquid, about 5 minutes.  Increase heat to
medium-high and saute until liquid evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add 1/2
teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, garlic, and thyme. Saute 30 seconds.  Add
flour and ground onions to skillet and cook for 1 minute.  Slowly whisk in
broth and cream and bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and
simmer until sauce gets very thick, about 10 minutes.

Place green beans in the slow cooker (6-quart slow cooker is best) and stir in
sauce. Cover and cook on low for 5 to 6 hours.  Remove lid, stir in cheese and
remaining salt and pepper. Turn heat setting to WARM and place lid back on.

For topping, pulse bread and butter in food processor until coarsely ground.
Place bread crumb mixture along with 2 cups fried onions in a large skillet
and heat over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 3 to 5 minutes.

When ready to serve, pour green bean mixture into a casserole dish and top
with onion mixture.
