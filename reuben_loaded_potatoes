Yield: 4 - 6 serving(s)
Prep Time: 10 mins
Cook Time: 50 mins

4 medium russet potatoes, cut into wedges
1 tbsp. olive oil
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
1/3 lb. thinly sliced corned beef, roughly chopped
1/2 c. sauerkraut
2 c. shredded Swiss cheese
1 tbsp. freshly chopped parsley, for garnish

Dressing:
3/4 c. mayonnaise
1/4 c. ketchup
1 tsp. Frank's Red Hot Sauce
1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1/2 tsp. onion powder
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper

Preheat oven to 400. In a large bowl, toss potato wedges with olive oil and
season with salt and pepper. Spread on an even layer on a medium baking sheet
and roast until tender and golden, 35 to 40 minutes.

Meanwhile, make dressing: In a medium bowl, whisk together mayo, ketchup, hot
sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and onion powder. Season with salt and pepper.
Refrigerate until ready to use. 

Top roasted potatoes with corned beef, sauerkraut, and Swiss cheese. Bake 10 to
12 minutes more, until cheese is melty and corned beef has crisped around the
edges. Drizzle with Russian dressing and garnish with parsley before serving.
