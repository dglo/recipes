For the sauce:

2-3/4 cups water
1/2 cup raw cashews
1 156ml can tomato paste
1 tablespoon garam masala
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger

For the butter cauliflower:

2 tablespoons vegan butter
1 yellow onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 head cauliflower, cut into florets (about 6 cups)

For serving:

cooked rice
naan bread
1 handful cilantro, roughly chopped

For the sauce, add all of the ingredients to a high-powered blender and blend
until smooth and creamy. If you do not have a high-powered blender, you may
want to soften the cashews first by boiling them in water for 10 minutes,
draining, and then adding to the blender with all of the remaining ingredients.
This will ensure a smooth sauce.

For the butter cauliflower, melt the vegan butter in a large pan or pot. When
melted add the onion and garlic and saut√© until the onion turns translucent
and just begins to brown. Pour in the prepared sauce, and stir in the
cauliflower florets. Cover and bring to a simmer. Stir the cauliflower often
so the sauce doesn't burn on the bottom of the pan. Cook until the cauliflower
is fork tender, about 10 minutes. Serve over rice with a side of naan and a
garnish of cilantro.
