PREP TIME: 10 min
COOK TIME: 45 min
SERVES: 4 to 6

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
2 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 pounds uniformly sized medium sweet potatoes (4 to 5), peeled and cut
   crosswise into 1-inch-thick rounds
1 tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves (from about 3 sprigs)
1 cup low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth
4 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed

Heat the oven to 500Â°F.
Stir 2 tablespoons melted unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons olive oil,
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a large
bowl until combined. Add 2 pounds peeled and cut sweet potatoes and 1
tablespoon coarsely chopped fresh rosemary leaves, and toss well to coat.

Transfer the potatoes cut-side up to a 9x13-inch metal baking pan (avoid glass,
as it could shatter) or rimmed baking sheet (quarter sheet pan) and arrange in
a single layer. Drizzle any remaining butter mixture over the potatoes.

Roast until the sweet potatoes easily release from the pan with tongs and the
bottoms are light golden-brown, about 15 minutes. Flip the rounds and roast
until the bottoms and tops are deep golden-brown, about 15 minutes more.

Remove the pan from the oven. Carefully pour 1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth
into the pan and add 4 peeled and smashed garlic cloves. Return to the oven and
roast until the potatoes are very tender and most of the broth is absorbed,
about 15 minutes.

NOtE: You can substitute any combination of chopped fresh hearty herbs (such
as thyme, sage, or oregano) for the rosemary.
