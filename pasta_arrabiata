Classic Pasta Arrabiata (adapted from Moosewood New Classics)

This also works well with additions such as broccoli, mushrooms (if you can
eat them), or faux meat.

2 medium onions, chopped
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 Tbsp (15 ml) extra virgin olive oil, preferably organic
1 tsp (5 ml) dried red pepper flakes
2 small or 1 large sweet red bell pepper, chopped
1 large can (28 ounces or 450-500 ml) diced tomatoes, with juice
1 large can (28 ounces or 450-500 ml) crushed (pureed) tomatoes
fine sea salt and pepper, to taste
3 Tbsp (45 ml) chopped fresh basil
enough cooked pasta of your choice for 4-6 servings (I used rice rotini)

In a large pot or dutch oven, heat the oil over medium heat; add the onions
and garlic and saute until the onion is browned and slightly caramelized,
about 10 minutes.  Add the pepper flakes and red pepper and continue to cook
for another 2 minutes, until the pepper softens. Add the tomatoes and heat
until the sauce begins to simmer; lower heat and cook, uncovered, until
thickened, about 15 minutes, stirring frequently.  Season with salt and
pepper and stir in the basil; cook until heated through, another 5 minutes or
so.  Serve over pasta.  Makes 4-6 servings.  May be frozen.
