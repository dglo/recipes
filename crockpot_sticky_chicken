Crockpot Roast Sticky Chicken 

4 tsp. salt 
2 tsp. paprika 
1 tsp. cayenne pepper 
1 tsp. onion powder 
1 tsp. thyme 
1 tsp. white pepper 
1/2 tsp. garlic powder 
1/2 tsp. black pepper 
1 large roasting chicken 

In a small bowl, thoroughly combine all the spices. Remove giblets from
chicken, clean the cavity well and pat dry with paper towels. Rub the spice
mixture into the chicken, both inside and out, making sure it is evenly
distributed and down deep into the skin. Place in a resealable plastic bag,
seal and refrigerate overnight. When ready to cook, put the bird into the
crockpot and do not add any liquid. As the cooking process goes on it will
produce it's own juices. Cook on low 8 - 10 hours and it will be falling off
the bone tender.
