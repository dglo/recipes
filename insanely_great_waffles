Waffles of Insane Greatness
recipe taken from foodnetwork.com 

3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. table salt
1 1/2 tsp. sugar
1 cup milk *I used 3/4 cup buttermilk and 1/4 cup milk
1/3 cup vegetable oil, such as canola *I subbed half the oil for applesauce
1 large egg, lightly beaten
3/4 tsp. vanilla extract
For a cinnamon nutmeg version: 1 tsp. ground cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda,
and salt; mix well. Add the milk, vegetable oil, egg, sugar and vanilla and
mix well. Let the batter sit for 30 minutes.

Preheat a waffle iron. Do not use non-stick spray on the waffle iron; the oil
in the batter will allow the waffle to release easily. Follow the directions
on your waffle iron to cook the waffles. Serve immediately with butter and
syrup.
