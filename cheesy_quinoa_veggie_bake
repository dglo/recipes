Yield: serves 4 as a main dish, 8 as a side dish
Prep Time: 30 minutes
Cook Time: 15 minutes
Total Time: 45 minutes

1 cup quinoa, rinsed and drained
2 cups water
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup broccoli florets
1 cup carrot coins
1 cup zucchini or yellow squash, chopped
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons flour
1 cup milk
4 ounces grated Gruyere cheese
4 ounces grated cheddar cheese, divided
salt and pepper, to taste

Add the quinoa, water, onion powder, and garlic powder to a small sauce pan and
bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 15
minutes or until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Place quinoa
in a large mixing bowl.

While the quinoa is cooking, steam the vegetables for 10 minutes or until tender
crisp. Add to the bowl with the quinoa.
Melt the butter in a small sauce pan. Whisk in the flour and continue cooking
and whisking for 2 minutes.
Slowly pour in the milk, whisking constantly, and continue cooking until
thickened, about 3 minutes.
Remove from the heat and stir in the Gruyere and 2 ounces of the cheddar. Whisk
until smooth and melted.
Pour the cheese sauce over the quinoa and vegetables and stir to combine. Taste
and add salt and pepper as needed.
Pour into a greased 2 quart casserole dish. Top with the remaining cheddar. Bake
at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.
Serve immediately.
