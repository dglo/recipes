Prep Time: 5 minutes
Cook Time: 10 minutes
Total Time: 45 minutes
Yield: 12 pancakes

2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
1 and 1/4 cups (285g) pumpkin puree (canned or fresh)
1/3 cup (67g) packed light or dark brown sugar
1 large egg
3 Tablespoons (45ml) canola or vegetable oil
1 and 1/2 cups (360ml) whole milk*
optional: 1 cup (180g) semi-sweet chocolate chips

In a large bowl, preferably with a pour spout, whisk the flour, baking powder,
baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice together
until combined. Set aside.

Add the pumpkin, brown sugar, egg, oil, and whole milk to a blender and blend
on high for 45 seconds until combined. Alternatively, you may whisk by hand or
use a hand mixer.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk gently to combine.
Make sure there are no patches of dry flour at the bottom of the bowl. The
batter is very thick and a few lumps are fine. Fold in the chocolate chips, if
using.

Heat a griddle or large flat skillet over medium heat. (If using an electric
griddle, preheat it to 375°F (190°C).) Coat generously with butter or nonstick
cooking spray. Once it’s hot, drop/pour a heaping 1/4 cup of batter on the
griddle. Cook until the edges look set and you notice holes in the pancake’s
surface around the border, about 2–3 minutes. Flip and cook the other side
until cooked through, about 1–2 more minutes. Coat griddle/skillet with butter
or nonstick spray again, if needed, for each batch of pancakes.

Keep pancakes warm in a preheated 200F (93C) oven until all pancakes are
cooked. Serve pancakes immediately with toppings of choice like butter and
pure maple syrup.

Cover and store leftover pancakes in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
