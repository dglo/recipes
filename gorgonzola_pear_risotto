Gorgonzola, pear and hazelnut risotto

1 knob butter 
150g arborio or Carnaroli rice 
500 ml vegetable stock 
125 ml dry white wine 
1 medium shallot 
100 g gorgonzola dolce, cut into cubes 
3 pears, tender 
smoked sea salt 
black pepper, freshly ground

Preheat the oven to 150 degrees Celsius. Line baking tray with some parchment
paper. Cut pear into slices are 2 mm thick, place them on a tray and put into
the hot oven. Bake for 30 minutes, flipping over in the halftime, until slices
are crisp and lightly golden. Roast the nuts on a dry pan, set aside to cool
down and crush in a mortar. 

Cut remaining pears in halves, remove cores and seeds and chop the fruit into
small cubes. Finely chop the shallot. 

In a pot or deep pan melt the butter. Add the shallot and cook over a medium
heat until translucent. Add the pears and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the rice
and fry until grains become glossy. Add the wine, turn up the heat and cook
until wine evaporates all. Reduce the heat, add two ladles of the stock to the
rice and cook until rice absorbs all the liquid. Add more stock and cook for
20-25 minutes, adding more stock, until rice is al dente. Add the cheese and
mix the risotto. Transfer onto plates or bowls, season with smoked salt and
pepper, top with crushed nuts and pear chips.
