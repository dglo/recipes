Steak and Guinness Pie
Happy Days with the Naked Chef

1.5 lb         stewing beef, diced
               sea salt & fresh ground pepper
2 heaping tbsp flour
               olive oil
1              onion, peeled and roughly chopped
1 large        carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
4 sticks       celery, washed and roughly chopped
2              parsnips, peeled and roughly chopped
1 handful      mixed fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, bay)
2.5 c.         Guinness or other stout
2 14oz cans    tomatoes
1lb 2oz pkg    puff pastry
1              egg, beaten

Season beef with salt & pepper, sprinkle with flour and toss until coated.
Heat 2-3 glugs of olive oil in a large casserole dish and fry meat (in 2
batches if needed) until golden brown.  Add onion and fry for 1 minute.
Add carrot, celery, parsnips and herbs and fry for 4 minutes.
Add Guinness and tomatoes and bring to a boil. Simmer for 2 hours or until
meat is tender and sauce is thickened.  Season.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Put meat filling into appropriately sized
baking dish or dishes.  Any high-sided ovenproof bowls can be used for
individual pies.  Cut out circles about 1/2 inch bigger than the tops of
the bowls.  Brush bowl rims with beaten egg, then place pastry circles on
top, pressing excess pastry onto outside of bowl.  Lightly score top of
pastry in a criss-cross fashion and brush with more egg.  Bake for 45
minutes until golden and bubbling.
