Serves 4

These meatless soft tacos are stuffed with sauteed vegetables and topped with
smoky salsa. To make it a meal, serve with Spanish rice, a tossed green salad
with red wine vinegar dressing and cantaloupe cubes.

1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium red onion, chopped (about 1 cup)
1 cup yellow summer squash
1 cup green zucchini
3 large garlic cloves, minced
4 medium tomatoes, seeded and chopped
1 jalapeno chili, seeded and chopped
1 cup fresh corn kernels (cut from about 2 ears of corn) or 1 cup frozen corn
1 cup canned pinto or black beans, rinsed and drained
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
8 corn tortillas
1/2 cup smoke-flavored salsa

Remove seed core from zucchini and squash, then cut into bite-sized pieces.
Sprinkle with salt and let sit for 20-30 minutes to sweat out some moisture.

In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and
cook until soft. Add the summer squash and zucchini, and continue cooking
until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, tomatoes, jalapeno, corn
kernels and beans. Cook until the vegetables are tender-crisp, about 5 minutes.
Add the cilantro and remove from the heat.

Heat a dry, large frying pan (without a nonstick surface) over medium heat. Add
one tortilla to the hot pan and heat until softened â€” about 20 seconds per side.
Repeat with the remaining tortillas.

To serve, divide the tortillas among individual plates. Scoop an equal amount of
the vegetable mixture onto each tortilla. Top each with 2 tablespoons of the
salsa. Serve immediately.
