Yield 6 servings
Time 1 hour

3 large leeks (1 to 1 1/2 pounds), white parts only,
              cleaned and sliced 1/2 inch thick
2 garlic cloves, minced
3 large carrots (10 ounces), diced
1 celery stalk, diced
1 large or 2 medium turnips (10 ounces), peeled and diced
1 pound russet potatoes, peeled and diced
A bouquet garni made with a bay leaf and a few sprigs each thyme and parsley
Salt and black pepper
1/4 cup crème fraîche, more to taste
Chopped fresh parsley or tarragon, for garnish

In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, combine the leeks, garlic, carrots, celery,
turnips, potatoes, bouquet garni, 1 1/2 quarts water, 2 to 3 teaspoons salt,
and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 40 to 45
minutes, until the vegetables are very soft.

Pass the soup through the coarse blade of a food mill (or purée using a
blender or an immersion blender).

Return soup to the pot and whisk in 1/4 cup crème fraîche (or more, to taste).
Heat through, taste and adjust seasonings (be generous with salt and pepper).
To serve, garnish each bowl with a spoonful of crème fraîche and a sprinkle of
parsley or tarragon.
