Huli Huli Chicken
https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020347-huli-huli-chicken

1/2 cup ketchup
1/2 cup soy sauce
1/2 cup packed light or dark brown sugar
1/4 cup rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar
1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated
2 to 3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated
3-1/2 to 4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces
Grapeseed or canola oil, for brushing the grill grate

In a large bowl or a gallon-size resealable plastic bag, combine the ketchup,
soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, ginger and garlic, and stir or shake
until combined. Reserve and refrigerate 1/2 cup of the mixture for basting the
chicken later. Add the chicken to the remaining mixture, and stir or shake
until evenly coated. If using a bowl, cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate
overnight, or at least 8 hours, turning the chicken at least once.

When youâ€™re ready to cook, oil your grill grates well. Heat the grill to
medium (for charcoal, the grill is ready when you can hold your hand 5 inches
above the coals for 5 to 7 seconds). Add the chicken to the grill, cover, and
cook 25 to 35 minutes, turning every 5 minutes to keep the chicken from
burning, and basting it with the reserved marinade after you turn it, until
cooked through. (Cook times will vary depending on sizes and cuts of chicken
pieces, so be sure to check for doneness: Meat should not be pink and the
juices should run clear.) Serve immediately
