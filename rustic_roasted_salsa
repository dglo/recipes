Rustic Roasted Tomato Salsa

2 fresh jalapeno peppers
2 garlic cloves, unpeeled
1/2 cup finely chopped white onion
1 15-ounce can diced fire-roasted tomatoes with garlic, in juice
1/2 cup (loosely packed) roughly chopped cilantro
1 lime, juiced
Salt and Pepper

Heat a small skillet over medium heat, and dry roast the peppers and garlic,
until soft and blotchy in spots.  The peppers will take about 10 minutes, and
the garlic will take about fifteen.

Meanwhile, rinse the onion in a fine-mesh strainer under cold water.  Shake to
dry, and set aside.

Stem and peel the jalapenos, and scrape out the seeds and membranes (or leave
them if you want the salsa extra spicy)!  Peel the garlic, and transfer it to
a food processor, along with the jalapenos.  Pulse until they are finely
chopped, then add the tomatoes (with their juice), and pulse a few more times
to make the salsa as smooth or as coarse as you want.  Pour the mixture into a
medium bowl, and add the onion, cilantro, and lime juice.  Stir to combine,
and add salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and refrigerate, or serve immediately.
