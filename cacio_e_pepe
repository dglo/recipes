Cacio E Pepe
https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cacio-e-pepe

Kosher salt
6 oz. pasta (such as egg tagliolini, bucatini, or spaghetti)
3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cubed, divided
1 tsp. freshly cracked black pepper
3/4 cup finely grated Grana Padano or Parmesan
1/3 quarts water

Bring 3 quarts of water to a boil in a 5-qt. pot. Season with salt; add pasta
and cook, stirring occasionally, until about 2 minutes before tender. Drain,
reserving 3/4 cup pasta cooking water.

Meanwhile, melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add
pepper and cook, swirling pan, until toasted, about 1 minute.

Add 1/2 cup reserved pasta water to skillet and bring to a simmer. Add pasta
and remaining butter. Reduce heat to low and add Grana Padano, stirring and
tossing with tongs until melted. Remove pan from heat; add Pecorino, stirring
and tossing until cheese melts, sauce coats the pasta, and pasta is al dente.
(Add more pasta water if sauce seems dry.) Transfer pasta to warm bowls and
serve.
