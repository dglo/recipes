Makes 4 servings

1 tbs olive oil
1/2 cup chopped onion
1 leek, chopped (only white and light green part)
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups fat free chicken broth
4 cups cauliflower, chopped
1 large russet potato, peeled and chopped
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp pepper
1/4 tsp smoked paprika
1/4 tsp chili powder
1/2 cup milk
1/2 cup light sour cream
1/4 cup shredded reduced fat cheddar cheese,
1 large tomato, chopped
1/2 cup green onion or chives, chopped

In a pot over medium high heat, add the leeks and onions, cook until
softened, stirring frequently. Add garlic and stir. Add the chicken broth,
potatoes, and cauliflower and allow to boil until vegetables are softened,
about 15 minutes.

Remove from heat. Using an immersion blender or a food processor, puree until
smooth. Stir in the spices and milk, return to heat and allow to simmer until
thickened to desired consistency (the longer you simmer, the thicker the soup
will become).

Divide among 4 bowls, top each one with 2 tbs sour cream and stir. Top with
remaining garnishes and serve.
