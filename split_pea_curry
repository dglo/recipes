Split Pea Curry
https://wholefully.com/split-pea-curry-2/

1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced (about 1 cup)
1/4 cup red curry paste
3 cups vegetable broth
2/3 cup split peas
1–14 ounce can diced tomatoes (fire roasted for best flavor)
1–14 ounce can light coconut milk
Salt and pepper, to taste
Cooked rice and warm naan, for serving

In a large skillet with high sides, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat.
Add in the onions and cook until just translucent and fragrant, about
3 minutes.

Add in the curry paste and stir. Continuing stirring for 1-2 minutes, or until
the curry paste becomes fragrant (this helps to reactivate the spices in the
curry paste).

Add in the vegetable broth and split peas. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and
simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the split peas have become tender (but not
mushy).

Add in the diced tomatoes and coconut milk. Continue to simmer for an
additional 20 minutes, or until the mixture is very thick and the split peas
are very tender.

Taste and adjust seasoning—some curry pastes are very salt-heavy, so you might
not need to add any seasoning at all.

Serve over hot rice and with a side of warm naan bread.
