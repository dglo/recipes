Active: 20 mins
Serves: 6 to 8 servings

1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil
6 ounces (175g) slab bacon, cut into 1/4- by 1/2-inch pieces
12 ounces (350g) kielbasa or other smoked Polish sausage, split lengthwise and
        cut into 1/2-inch pieces
1 medium onion, thinly sliced (about 6 ounces; 175g)
1 medium carrot, cut into 1/2-inch dice (about 4 ounces; 120g)
1 small head cabbage, cut into 1/2- to 1/4-inch shreds (about 12 ounces; 350g)
8 ounces sauerkraut with juice (1 cup; 240ml)
8 cups (1.9L) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock
2 bay leaves
1/4 cup (60ml) chopped fresh dill, stems reserved separately
1 large russet potato, peeled, split in quarters lengthwise, and cut into
        1/2-inch pieces (about 10 ounces; 280g)
Kosher salt
1 tablespoon (10g) cornstarch
2 teaspoons (8g) paprika
1/2 teaspoon (2g) freshly ground white pepper, plus more for seasoning
Fresh crusty bread, for serving

Heat oil in a large soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering.
Add bacon and kielbasa and cook, stirring, until fat is rendering and bacon and
sausage are browning in spots, about 5 minutes. Add onion and carrot and cook,
stirring, until softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add cabbage and
cook, stirring, until lightly wilted, about 3 minutes. Add sauerkraut with its
juice, chicken stock, bay leaves, dill stems, and potato. Season to taste with
salt.

Increase heat to high and bring soup to a boil. Reduce to a bare simmer and
cook until potato is tender, about 10 minutes. Stir together cornstarch,
paprika, and 1/2 teaspoon white pepper in a small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon (15ml)
cold water and stir to form a slurry. Pour slurry into the soup and stir until
evenly distributed. Return to a boil (soup should thicken very slightly).
Season to taste with more salt and white pepper as desired. Stir in chopped
dill and serve with bread.
