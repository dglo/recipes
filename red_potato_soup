Ingredients
2 pounds redskin potatoes, diced into 2" cubes
2 stalks celery, diced
3 carrots, diced
1 large onion, diced
3/4 tsp salt
1 cup light sour cream
1/4 tsp ground pepper
4 cups vegetable stock
2 cups water
1 cup shredded cheese
3 strips bacon
scallions
parsley, a large handful, chopped, plus a few tablespoons reserved

Cook bacon in the bottom of a large soup pot over medium until fat is rendered
and bacon is crispy. Remove bacon from pot and drain all but 1 tablespoon of
the remaining fat.

Add diced celery, carrots, and onions to the pot and cook 5-8 minutes, until
tender and browning. Add potatoes and stir to combine. Season with salt and
pepper.

Add stock and water and bring to a gentle boil. Cook 45 minutes or until
potatoes are very tender.

Remove 2/3 of the soup and blend it in a blender or food processor, then
return it to the soup pot.

Remove soup from heat and add shredded cheese and sour cream. Taste again for
seasonings and stir in chopped parsley.  Serve with chopped scallions and
parsley, if desired.
