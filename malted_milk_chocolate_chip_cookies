Malted Milk Chocolate Chip Cookies
Prep Time 15 Minutes
Cook Time 12 Minutes
Servings 36

1 cup (2 Sticks) Unsalted Butter Softened
3/4 cups Golden Brown Sugar
3/4 cups Sugar
2 whole Eggs
2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract
2 cups All-purpose Flour
1-1/4 teaspoon Baking Soda
1-1/4 teaspoon Salt
1/2 cups (rounded) Malted Milk Powder
1 bag (12 Ounce) Milk Chocolate Chips

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

Cream butter, then add both sugars and cream until fluffy. Add eggs and beat
slightly, then add vanilla and beat until combined. Add malted milk powder and
beat until combined.

Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt. Add to butter mixture, beating
gently until just combined.

Add chocolate chips and stir in gently.

Drop by teaspoonfuls (or use a cookie scoop) and bake for 10 to 12 minutes.
Bake less if you want chewy cookies; more if you want crispy cookies.

Optional: Allow to cool completely, then use two cookies to make an ice cream
sandwich. Add sprinkles to the sides of the ice cream, then wrap individually
in plastic wrap.
