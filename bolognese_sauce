Prep Time: 15 mins
Cook Time: 3 hours
Yield: Serves up to 6   

3 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil (I used Greek Private Reserve)
1 small onion, chopped
1 celery stalk, chopped
2 small carrots, chopped
3/4 lb ground turkey (or lean ground beef, if you prefer)
Kosher salt
Black pepper
1 cup/ 250 ml whole milk
1/8 tsp ground nutmeg
1 cup dry white wine
7 whole canned plum tomatoes (about 1 1/2 cup), cut up

In a heavy saucepan, add extra virgin olive oil and onions. Heat on medium.
Cook and stir the onions until translucent about 5 minutes, then add celery
and carrots. Cook for another 3 minutes, stirring frequently.

Add ground turkey (or lean ground beef, if you prefer). Add a large pinch
kosher salt and ground black pepper.  Using a wooden spoon, break up the meat.
Stir well until meat is no longer raw and it loses its red color.

Add milk and let it come to a gentle simmer. Stir frequently until milk has
completely bubbled away. Stir in nutmeg.

Add wine and let it simmer until it has completely evaporated, then stir in
the plum tomatoes.

Once tomatoes come to a gentle bubble, turn heat down to a very low simmer.
Cook sauce, uncovered, for 3 hours or so.

IMPORTANT: occasionally check if you need to add a little liquid to the sauce.
If it looks dry or starts to stick, you can add about 1/2 cup of liquid (water
or some of tomato water from your plum tomato can.)  At the end, there should
be no water remaining.

Taste the bolognese sauce and correct for salt.

Toss with your favorite cooked and drained pasta with a side of Parmesan.
