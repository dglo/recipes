2 boxes of frozen spinach, drained (I used one chopped, and one whole leaf)
1 lb of extra firm tofu
1 yellow onion, diced
3 smashed and chopped garlic cloves
1 can garbanzo beans, drained
2 inches of ginger, peeled and grated
1/2 tsp kosher salt (and then more later to taste)
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp curry
1 Tbl coriander
1/2 tsp chile powder
1/2 tsp garam masala
1/2 cup water

cornstarch (to coat the tofu)
butter (to fry the tofu)

Use a 3 or 4 quart crockpot.

Drain your tofu. Squeeze it in between some paper towels or a clean dish
cloth if need-be to get as much of the liquid out as you can.

Cut it into 1-inch cubes and toss it with corn starch. Fry in butter until
golden brown--resist the urge to flip; tofu takes a while to brown.

While the tofu is browning, squeeze out all of the moisture from the
spinach and dump it into your crockpot. Dice up the onion, and mince the
garlic.  Add that, too. Drain your garbanzo beans, and pour them in. Add
all of the spices.

Stir in 1/2 cup of water.

Add the tofu to the very top of the spinach.

Cover and cook on low for about 4 hours. This doesn't take very long to
cook.  Serve over white rice, and scoop up with naan, pitas, or corn
tortillas.
