1 pack Firm or extra firm tofu
1 Egg
3/4 cup Cornstarch
3 tbs. Chicken boullion (optional)
Vegetable oil
5 Sliced green onions
1/2 Green or red pepper chopped
2 tbs Minced ginger
2 tbs Minced garlic
1 1/3 cup Vegetable broth
4 tbs Soy sauce
6-8 tbs Sugar
Red pepper flakes to taste
1 tbs (optional) Sherry
1-2 tbs Vinegar
Sesame seeds to garnish

Drain the tofu between paper towels (set a plate on top of tofu for about 15
mins to drain) then cut into 1 inch chunks.

Whisk egg with 2 Tbs. water. In a separate bowl or a bag mix cornstarch with
boullion if using.

Dip tofu chunks into egg mixture then coat with cornstarch mixture. Fry in hot
oil until golden brown. You may need to do this in batches if your pan is not
big enough. Drain the browned tofu on paper towels.

In a small amount of oil in a separate pan fry the onions, peppers, ginger and
garlic for about 2 minutes at a medium heat. When garlic starts to brown add
the broth, soy sauce, sugar, pepper flakes, vinegar and sherry if using.

Quickly whisk 1 Tbs of cornstarch with 2 Tbs of water and add this to the pan,
stirring to thicken the sauce. As soon as the sauce begins to thicken remove
from heat and add the tofu to the sauce. Garnish with sesame seeds.

Serve with cooked rice, steamed broccoli and a fortune cookie.

NOTE: Freezing the tofu before using makes the texture more "meat-like". If
you choose to do this freeze overnight then thaw in refrigerator for at least
12 hours before draining the tofu. Morningstar Farms chicken strips can be
used in place of the tofu if you prefer.
