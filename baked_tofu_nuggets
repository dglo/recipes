Serves 6

1 block (250 grams) firm or extra-firm tofu, drained on paper towel
1/2 cup soy milk
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon garlic powder
pinch cayenne pepper
2 cups unseasoned breadcrumbs
salt and pepper
Non-stick Cooking Spray

Preheat the oven to 425F. Lightly spray a baking sheet with cooking spray.

Cut tofu into 1-inch squares and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together
milk and Dijon mustard. Add tofu to the milk mixture and set aside.

In a separate bowl mix together the garlic powder, cayenne, breadcrumbs and
season with salt and pepper. Add the tofu to the breadcrumbs and gently toss
to coat. Carefully shake off any excess.

Arrange tofu pieces in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake for 25 minutes,
turning once halfway through until golden brown. Serve warm.
