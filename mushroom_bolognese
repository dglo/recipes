Mushroom Bolognese

2 medium onions
1 tsp brown sugar
2 cloves of garlic
1-1/2 pints of mushrooms (i used porcinni ) 
2 tsp balsamic glaze or balsamic vinegar
1 large jar of organic tomato puree 
1 tsp brown organic sugar
salt 
pepper
some fresh herbs - basil, oregano, thyme

Fry onion in some olive oil and season with salt. Once it starts to change
color add a teaspoon of sugar. Add garlic and lightly brown then remove all
from the pan. In the same pan fry chopped up mushrooms, add some balsamic
glaze or balsamic vinegar and cook the mushrooms through. Add the cooked onion
and garlic back into the pan with the mushrooms. Add a jar of tomato puree and
add sugar, salt, pepper and fresh herbs (basil, thyme and oregano) then simmer
until flavors infuse.
