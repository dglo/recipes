Easy Slow Cooker Butternut Squash Soup
http://pumpsandiron.com/2015/11/18/easy-slow-cooker-butternut-squash-soup/

1 large butternut squash (pitted, peeled and chopped)
2 large apples (peeled, cored and chopped), I used Honeycrisp
1 yellow onion (peeled and diced)
4 large carrots (cleaned, stems removed and chopped)
4 large stalks celery (cleaned, ends removed and chopped)
1 box low-sodium vegetable broth (about 4 cups)
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1/2 - 1 tsp nutmeg
Salt and pepper to taste (I usually am super generous with the pepper!)

Put everything in the slow cooker on high for 3-4 hours or low 6-8 hours.
Squash should be soft and easily squished with a fork.

Transfer to a blender (you'll probably have to do this in two batches) and
blend until fully combined. If you have an immersion blender, it'd probably
be easier to use that right in the slow cooker.

Serve warm. I like to top mine with croutons and parmesan cheese!
