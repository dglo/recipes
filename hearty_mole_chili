Prep Time: 15 minutes
Cook Time: 1 hour 5 minutes

2 tablespoons olive oil
2 large yellow onions, peeled and thinly sliced
2 celery stalks, diced
2 large carrots, peeled, and diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon instant espresso powder
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 chipotle chili in adobo, seeds removed, minced
1 tablespoon adobo

1/2 cup white wine

2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
2 large poblano or pasilla peppers, charred, steamed, seeded, peeled, and diced
28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
15-ounce can black beans, with liquid
15-ounce can white beans, with liquid
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 cups frozen corn

1/2 cup green onions, washed and thinly sliced
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, washed and minced

Optional toppings: sour cream or non-fat Greek yogurt, grated sharp cheddar,
                   crumbled cotija cheese, sliced avocado

In a large pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onions and saute until
soft, about 10 minutes. Add celery, carrots, and minced garlic. Saute for an
additional 3 minutes.

Add espresso powder, cumin, paprika, cinnamon, chipotle chili, and adobo and
cook for about 2 minutes. Deglaze the pot by adding the white wine and
scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen up stuck residue.

Add the chocolate, poblano peppers, tomatoes, black and white beans, water,
and soy sauce. Bring mixture to a boil and then reduce heat to a simmer.
Simmer for 20 minutes and then add the frozen corn. Cook for an additional 15
minutes and then remove from heat. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.

Top with green onions and cilantro. Garnish with optional toppings.
