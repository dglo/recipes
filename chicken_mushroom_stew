Prep time:  15 mins
Cook time:  30 mins
Serves: 4
 
1 lb. chicken breast, boneless, skinless, cut into bite-sized pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 small onion, chopped
1 leek, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced (white and light green part only)
1 stalk celery, diced
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 lb. button mushrooms, rinsed and sliced
1.4 cup red wine
1 tablespoon tomato paste
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon cornstarch
salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
chopped parsley, for garnish

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a Dutch oven or a large pan over medium-high
heat and add the chicken. Season with 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper. Saute
until chicken is no longer pink outside, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken from
pan and set aside.

In the same pan, heat the remaining olive oil. Add the onion, leek, celery,
thyme, and rosemary and cook, stirring often, until softened (about 5 minutes).
Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute to soften. Add the mushrooms and cook,
stirring occasionally, until softened and any liquid is released, about 5-6
minutes. Add the red wine, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce and chicken
along with any accumulated juices to the pan. Bring to a boil, then reduce
heat to low. Cover and cook, stirring once or twice, until the chicken is
tender, about 10 minutes. Taste and add more salt or pepper, if desired.

Meanwhile, mix cornstarch and water in a small bowl. Stir the mixture into the
stew and cook until thickened, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat. Garnish
with parsley and serve with boiled potatoes or rice.
