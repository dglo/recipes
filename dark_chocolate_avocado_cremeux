Dark Chocolate Avocado Cremeux

8 large ripe, but firm avocados
1/2 cup dutch processed cocoa
100 ml honey or amber maple syrup
1 tsp vanilla

Put the avocado flesh, cocoa, maple syrup, and vanilla in a food processor and puree until very smooth, scraping down the sides occasionally. Spoon into dessert glasses, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and chill for at least 4 hours or until set.
