PESTO PASTA WITH ROASTED VEGETABLES [VEGAN]
http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-recipe/pesto-pasta-with-roasted-vegetables/
Serves: 4

Pasta:
1 garlic bulb
2 tomatoes
4 zucchinis
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1/2 teaspoon oregano
A pinch of sea salt
A pinch of black pepper
12 ounces pasta

Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Line baking pan with parchment paper.

Cut off the top of the garlic bulb so the garlic cloves are exposed. Drizzle
exposed garlic cloves with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. Wrap garlic bulb in
aluminum foil.

Roast in oven for 40 minutes or until the cloves are golden in color. Keep in
mind that you can roast everything at the same time; however, the garlic takes
longer to cook so you should start that first. When finished, allow to cool
for 10-15 minutes before gently squeezing each garlic clove out of the skin.

Chop zucchini into semi-circles and place into large bowl. Chop tomatoes and
add to bowl.  Toss with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, oregano, salt,
and pepper.

Pour vegetables onto parchment-lined pan and spread out evenly. Roast in oven
for 15 minutes, flip, and continue roasting for 15 minutes.

Cook pasta in boiling water, according to package directions. Rinse with cold
water. Drain and set aside.

When vegetables and garlic are done roasting, toss with pasta and pesto.
