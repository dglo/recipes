Yield: About 10 biscuits
Prep time: 15 minutes
Cook time: 12 minutes
Total time: 30 minutes

2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
4 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (about 1 cup shredded)
1 cup buttermilk, cold
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled for 5 minutes

For the Topping:
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, divided
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon minced fresh parsley (or 1/4 teaspoon dried)

Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a
non-stick baking mat; set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar,
salt, garlic powder and cayenne. Stir in the cheddar cheese; set aside.

In a medium bowl, stir together the buttermilk and melted butter until the
butter forms small clumps.

Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and mix gently with a rubber
spatula just until a dough forms and no dry ingredients remain. Use a greased
1/4-cup measuring cup to scoop out portions of dough. Place on the prepared
baking sheet, leaving a little more than an inch between biscuits.

Bake until the biscuits are golden brown, about 12 minutes. While the biscuits
are in the oven, stir together the 2 tablespoons melted butter, garlic powder
and parsley. Remove the biscuits from the oven and immediately brush with the
topping mixture. Allow to cool for at least 5 minutes before serving.
Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container or zip-top back at room
temperature for up to 3 days.
