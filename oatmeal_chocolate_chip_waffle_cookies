Oatmeal-Chocolate Chip Waffle Cookies
Enough batter for about 24 cookies.

1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons firmly packed light brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (not instant)
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips
Nonstick cooking spray

Heat the waffle iron according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.  In a large
bowl, whisk the butter and brown sugar until smooth. Whisk in the eggs and
vanilla. Stir in the flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir in the oats and
chocolate chips.

Coat the grids of the waffle iron with nonstick cooking spray. Use a
tablespoon or small ice cream scoop to portion out a cookie onto each waffle
square. Close the iron and cook until set and beginning to brown, 1-1/2 to 3
minutes, depending on the heat of your waffle iron. Use a thin metal spatula
to transfer the cooked cookies to a wire rack and repeat with the remaining
dough, coating the grids with spray as necessary.
