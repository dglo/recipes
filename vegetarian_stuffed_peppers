SERVES: 6
Serves TIME: 20 min
Cook Time: 1 hr 20 min

4 large red bell peppers
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil or vegetable oil
1/2 medium yellow onion, diced
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup uncooked white rice
1 2/3 cups vegetable broth
1 (13.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes
3 to 4 green onions, chopped
2 tablespoons taco seasoning (homemade or store bought)
1 (13.5-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup frozen corn
1 cup shredded pepper jack cheese
Minced fresh cilantro (optional)

Preheat the oven to 400Â°F with a rack in the center position. Grease a
9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil.

Trim, deseed, and dice one of the bell peppers. Halve the remaining bell
peppers lengthwise, keeping the stems intact as much as possible. Discard the
seeds and ribs.

Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is glistening,
add the onion and cook, stirring, until just softened, about 4 minutes. Stir
in the rice and salt and cook for about 3 minutes more. Stir in the broth,
tomatoes, green onions, taco seasoning, and bell pepper.Bring the rice mixture
to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, about
25 minutes. Stir in black beans and corn, until fully combined and warmed
through.

Arrange the peppers in the prepared baking dish and fill them with the rice
mixture, dividing evenly. Top with cheese. Bake, uncovered, until cheese is
bubbling and golden brown, about 40 minutes.

Sprinkle with cilantro, if desired, and serve.
