Creamy White Sauce Chicken Enchiladas

2 tablespoons butter
1 medium onion, chopped
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1-1/2 cups chicken broth, I used homemade
1 cup chopped green chile peppers, I used mild fire roasted green chile
    peppers in the jar from Fred Meyer
3 clove garlic, finely chopped, more if desired
1 teaspoon Kosher salt, or season to taste
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin, more if desired
6 flour tortillas
1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
1 cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese
2 cups shredded, cooked chicken breast meat
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 â€“ 1 cup any cheese to sprinkle over the top
green onion & cilantro, chopped for garnish

Salsa Verde:
Using a pot, over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of butter then add 1 chopped
onion, cook until soft about 3-5 minutes.

Stir in 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour, cook for 1 minute, stirring continuously.

Pour in 1-1/2 cup of chicken broth. Then add 1 cup of chopped green chile
peppers, 3 chopped garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon Kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon
ground cumin, simmer over medium/low heat for 5 minutes, stirring few times.

Chicken Enchiladas:
Preheat oven to 350F.

Dip a flour tortilla in the salsa Verde sauce, then turn over and dip the other
side. Put 1/4 cup chicken breast in the center of the tortilla. Sprinkle about
2 tablespoons Monterey Jack cheese & 2 tablespoons mild Cheddar cheese. Roll
the tortilla into a roll, and place it in a baking dish. Repeat 5 times.

Spread the rest of Salsa Verde sauce over the top of the enchiladas. Pour 1
cup heavy whipping cream and sprinkle 1 cup cheese. Place enchiladas in the
oven & bake uncovered for 20 minutes.

Garnish with chopped green onion & cilantro. Serve with green lettuce & salsa.
Enjoy!
