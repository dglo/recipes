Vegetable Soft Tacos with Chipotle Sour Cream

2 cups corn (fresh or frozen)
2 limes, juiced
2 tsp cumin
1 1/2 tsp paprika
1 tsp salt
1 T olive oil
2 red bell peppers, sliced thin
1 red onion, sliced thin

1 T olive oil
1 1/2 tsp paprika
1 tsp salt
1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed (or make your own!)

1 green cabbage, sliced thin
1 bunch fresh cilantro, minced
1 T white vinegar
1 1/2 tsp sugar
1 avocado
3 radishes, sliced thin

1 cup sour cream
2 canned chilies in adobo sauce, seeded and diced + 2 tsp of the adobo sauce
1/2 cup shredded monterey jack cheese
whole wheat tortillas

Preheat oven to 425.

Toss together corn, 1 tbsp of the olive oil, lime juice, 1 tsp salt, cumin,
bell peppers and onion in a large bowl then spread out on half a baking sheet.

In another large bowl, toss together the remaining tbsp of olive oil, paprika,
1 tsp salt and black beans. Spread on the other half of the baking sheet.

Bake for 20-25 minutes, tossing occasionally, until beans are crispy and
veggies are cooked.

While that's going, combine the cabbage, cilantro, vinegar, sugar, diced
avocado, radishes and a pinch of salt. Set aside.

In a small bowl, mix together the sour cream, chipotle peppers and adobo sauce.

When veggies/beans are done, fill tortillas with them then layer on cabbage
mixture and a drizzle of sour cream. Sprinkle with cheese.
