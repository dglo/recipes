1 lb ground chicken (or pork)
1 teaspoon oil
1/2 cup diced mushrooms
1/2 cup diced water chestnuts
2 green onions, sliced
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 14 oz. bag coleslaw mix (shredded cabbage and carrots)
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 teaspoon fish sauce (such as Red Boat)
1/3 cup soy sauce
1 teaspoon grated ginger

Heat oil in a large, deep skillet.  Add ground chicken and break up into small
bits.  Cook until no longer pink. 

Add mushrooms, water chestnuts, green onion, and garlic to the pan.  Stir and
cook for 1-2 minutes.  

In a small dish, combine sesame oil, fish sauce, coconut aminos, and ginger.
Whisk well.

Add coleslaw mix to the pan and stir to combine.  Pour sauce over mixture and
cook, stirring often, for about 4-5 minutes.  Slaw should be wilted but still
have a little crunch.  

Serve with additional green onions as a garnish, if desired.
