Red Flannel Hash

1 medium red beet
1 small-medium sweet potato
1 medium shallot
1 large clove of garlic
2 tbs extra virgin olive oil
1 tbs red wine vinegar (plus 1 tbs for poaching egg)
Salt and pepper to taste
1 egg
1/4 cup Greek yogurt (optional)
drizzle of honey (optional)

Peel the beet and slice into small half inch cubes. Cut the sweet potato the
same way, leaving skin on. Finally, cut the shallot and garlic into large
pieces. Combine all of the vegetables in a medium pyrex and toss with olive
oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Roast at 400 degrees for about 40 minutes or
until beets are soft. Toss veggies occasionally while they are in the oven so
they don't stick to the pan.

When veggies are about 10 minutes away from being finished, bring about 2"
of water and 1 tbs vinegar to boil in a small pot. Once water boils, reduce to
simmer, crack egg into a cup and pour into the simmering water. Scoop any
whites towards the yolk. Let cook for about 3-4 minutes.

While the egg is cooking, remove hash from oven and if you like a slightly
sweet kick, drizzle a very small amount of honey over the hash, mix together,
and plate. Add a dollop of Greek yogurt on top of the hash and then top with
the poached egg.
