Prep time: 5 MINUTES
Cook time: 15 MINUTES

2 tablespoons oil
1 cup diced white onion
4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
(optional) 1 jalapeño, cored and diced
1/4 cup chili powder*
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
2 1/2 cups vegetable stock
2 tablespoons smooth almond butter (or your preferred nut or seed butter)
1 tablespoon tomato paste
1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon sea salt

Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sauté for
5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent.  Add garlic and
jalapeño (if using) and sauté for 1-2 more minutes, stirring occasionally,
until fragrant.  Add chili powder, flour, cinnamon, cumin, and oregano, and
stir until everything is evenly mixed.  Continue sautéing for 1 more minute,
stirring occasionally.

Remove pan from heat.  Add vegetable stock, and stir until combined.

Use an immersion blender to puree the mixture until smooth.  Or transfer it in
two small batches to a traditional blender, and purée until smooth, being very
careful (**see note below) since warm liquids expand when they are blended.

Return the saucepan to medium-high heat.  Add almond butter, tomato paste,
cocoa powder and sea salt, and whisk until combined.  Continue cooking until
the mixture reaches a simmer and the sauce as thickened.

Reduce heat to medium-low.  Taste, and season the sauce with more salt if
needed.

Serve warm.  Or let the sauce cool to room temperature, then refrigerate in a
sealed container for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
