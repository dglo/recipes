Green Chile Veggie Bowl

2 cups cooked rice

1-2 Tbsp canola or vegetable oil
1/2 c red onion, coarsely diced
1 yellow squash, quartered and sliced
1 orange or red pepper, cut into bite-sized pieces
3/4 c corn
4 oz can green chiles (not drained!)

1 can black or pinto beans
Cheddar cheese
Sour cream
Salsa

Cook a couple of cups of rice, following the directions on the rice package.

Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high. Saute red onion for a couple of
minutes. Add red pepper and saute for a few more minute, until peppers start
to soften.  Add yellow squash and cook for a couple more minutes then add
corn and cook another minute or two until corn is heated,

Heat the beans in a small saucepan.

Place a cup or so of rice in a bowl, then add the vegetables and cheese (or add
the cheese first so it melts between the hot rice and vegetables).  Top as
desired with sour cream and salsa.  Enjoy!
