Vegan Louisiana Red Beans and Rice

1 pound small red beans
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large onion, diced
6 cloves garlic
3 medium green peppers
chopped 3 stalks celery, chopped
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon ground sage
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 chipotle peppers (from canned chipotles in adobo), finely chopped
1/3 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3 cups vegetable stock
2-3 cups water
1 tablespoon vegan and/or gluten-free Worcestershire sauce
1/2 cup chopped scallions, for garnish
Cooked rice, for serving
Tabasco sauce, for serving

Soak the beans overnight, or use the quick soak method. Drain and set aside.

Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large heavy pot. Add the onion,
garlic, peppers and celery. Saute until soft, about 5-6 minutes. Add the
beans, bay leaves, sage, oregano, chipotles, cayenne, stock, 2 cups of water
and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer,
uncovered, until the beans are tender (this may take anywhere from 45 minutes
to two hours, depending on the age of your beans.) Add more water as needed to
keep the beans from drying out; when dine, the mixture should be saucy yet
slightly thick. If it seems too watery, mash a cup of the beans and stir back
in. (The dish will also naturally thicken overnight if you are serving it the
next day.)

Remove the bay leaves and serve on rice, passing the Tabasco.

Serves 6-8
