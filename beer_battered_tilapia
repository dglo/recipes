Beer Battered Tilapia

2 cups flour, plus more for dredging fish
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
2 eggs
14 oz beer
4-6 pieces of tilapia (or any mild white fish), about 4 oz each
vegetable oil
homemade tartar sauce
lemon wedges

Combine flour, baking powder, salt and pepper in a medium size mixing bowl.
Whisk in eggs and beer until batter is smooth.  Dredge fish fillets in flour.
Dip fish in batter.  Pour 1 inch of oil in a deep skillet or a dutch oven.
Heat over medium high heat to 350 degrees.  Add 3 to 4 pieces of fish to hot
oil, making sure you don't crowd the pan.  Fry in batches if necessary.  Cook
for 2-3 minutes per side, until golden brown.  Remove from pan and drain on
paper towels.  Serve immediately with tartar sauce and lemon wedges.
