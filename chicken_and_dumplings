Yield: Serves 4 to 6
Active time: 45 minutes
Total time:1 hour 15 minutes 

6 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided
1 1/2 quarts (48 ounces) homemade or store-bought low sodium chicken broth
1 cup leftover gravy (optional)
1 large onion, finely sliced (about 1 1/2 cups)
2 medium carrots, chopped medium (about 1 1/2 cups)
3 medium ribs celery, chopped medium (about 1 1/2 cups)
1 pound leftover roast turkey or chicken, torn into rough bite-sized pieces
1 1/2 cups thawed frozen peas
1/2 cup minced fresh parsley leaves
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 tablespoons minced fresh chives
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 whole egg

Heat 3 tablespoons butter in a large Dutch oven or saucepan over medium-high
heat until melted. Add 3 tablespoons flour and cook, stirring constantly,
until pale golden brown, about 3 minutes. Slowly whisk in broth. Add gravy,
onions, carrots, and celery. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally,
until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in turkey, peas, and
half of parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.

Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Combine remaining 1 1/2 cups flour,
baking powder, chives, remaining parsley, and 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt in a
medium bowl. Combine buttermilk, eggs, and butter in a second bowl. Pour
buttermilk mixture over flour mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until it
forms a shaggy dough.

Return stew to a bare simmer. Using a tablespoon measure, drop dumpling dough
in 1-inch balls over surface of stew. Cover and cook until dumplings have
puffed and feel firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center of
one comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.
