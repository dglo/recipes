Total Time: 40 MIN
Serves : 4

1 cup finely shredded cabbage
1 small scallion, finely chopped
1-1/2 tsp fresh lime juice
Salt and freshly ground pepper
1/2 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds
1/4 cup mayonnaise
Vegetable oil
1/2 cup kimchi, drained and patted dry
4 hot dog buns, split
4 all-beef hot dogs, partially split
1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar
1 cup shredded romaine
1/2 small onion, thinly sliced
1 cup cilantro sprigs
Sriracha, for drizzling 

In a large bowl, toss the cabbage, scallion and lime juice; season with salt
and pepper. In a mortar, pound the sesame seeds until crushed and transfer to
a small bowl. Stir in the mayonnaise and season with salt.

In a nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the kimchi and cook over
high heat until browned all over, 3 minutes.

Light a grill. Brush the insides of the buns with oil and grill over
moderately high heat, cut side down, until crisp, 20 seconds. Turn and grill
for 20 seconds longer. Spread the cut sides with the sesame mayonnaise.

Grill the hot dogs over moderately high heat until nicely charred all over,
3 minutes. Tuck the hot dogs into the buns with the kimchi and cheddar. Top
with the cabbage salad, romaine, onion and cilantro sprigs. Drizzle a little
Sriracha on top and serve
