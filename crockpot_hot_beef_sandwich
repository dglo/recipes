Hot Beef Sandwich
Serves 8

1 tbsp extra Virgin olive oil, divided
2 pounds beef cubes
1 large onion, sliced in sticks
3 Cloves garlic, crushed
1/4 Cup red wine
2 Cups sodium-reduced beef stock
2 tbsp tomato paste
1/2 tsp salt, plus more
1/4 tsp pepper, plus more

Heat a 1/2 tbsp of the oil in a frying pan and place it over medium-high heat,
when it’s hot add half of the beef; season with salt and pepper.

Brown the beef in batches, using a 1/2 tbsp at a time; season with salt and pepper of course!

Transfer the browned beef to the crockpot but the beef won’t be cooked through
yet so don’t worry about that.

Add the onion and the garlic to the crockpot.

Add the wine, stock, and tomato paste to the frying pan you browned the beef
cubes in; mix well and bring to a boil (you want the tomato paste completely
dissolved).

Transfer the contents of the frying pan to the crockpot and add the 1/2 salt
and 1/4 tsp pepper; mix well.

Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours.

Serve on top of your favourite bread that you’ve toasted (I went with crunchy,
yummy garlic bread).
