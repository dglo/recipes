Prep Time: 10 minutes

Servings: 4

1 pound mahi mahi fillets cut into four portions
5-6 green scallions thinly sliced
5 cloves garlic minced
3 shallots thinly sliced
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 8- oz can good quality tomato sauce
1/4-1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes depending on how spicy you like it
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
2-3 grinds of black pepper
3/4 cup water divided
juice of half a lemon
chopped parsley for garnish

2 cups cooked long grain white rice - you want the rice to be sticky -- NOT converted rice.

In a 9" or 10" skillet with a lid add the olive oil and heat over medium low
heat. Add the scallions, garlic and shallots and cook, stirring occasionally
until vegetables are soft and translucent, about 10-15 minutes. (Don't crank
up the heat - you don't want these vegetables to brown).

Add the tomato sauce, red pepper flakes, bay leaves, salt, pepper and 1/2 cup
water. Stir to combine and continue cooking, uncovered until sauce has
thickened somewhat, about 10 minutes.

Stir in the remaining 1/4 cup water and place the fish fillets in the poaching
liquid. Put the lid on securely and poach the fish on low to medium low heat
for about 8 minutes. Using tongs or a spatula, flip the fish over and continue
to poach an additional 7-8 minutes. Remove from heat. Squeeze lemon juice over
the fish and chopped parsley. Serve on top of sticky white rice. A cool
cucumber salad is really good with this to take the heat off.
