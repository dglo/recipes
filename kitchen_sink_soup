Makes 6 quarts, about 12 large servings

1 pound lean ground meat, such as hamburger, elk, or turkey
2 medium or one giant onion, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups cooked brown lentils
2 cups cooked black beans
2 cups frozen corn
4-6 carrots, sliced
4-6 potatoes, sliced thin
2 cups shredded cabbage
1 medium zucchini, quartered and then sliced
1 quart whole tomatoes, about 4 cups (if you don't bottle at home, store-bought whole or diced tomatoes work well too)
1 quart broth
1 tsp. fresh chopped rosemary
1 tsp. fresh chopped thyme
2 T. fresh chopped basil
1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley
1 T. salt
1 tsp. black pepper

In a skillet cook the ground meat, onion, and garlic until the meat is cooked through and no longer pink. Add the meat mixture to a large 6-quart crock pot. Add all of the other ingredient. While you are pouring the tomatoes in, crush them with your hands before they fall into the crock pot.  Place the lid on the clock pot and cook for 6-8 hours on low or 4-6 hour on high. Add salt and pepper to taste and serve with hot bread.
