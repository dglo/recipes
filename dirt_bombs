Claire Saffitz’ Dirt Bombs
Makes 18

MUFFINS
2 cups plus 2 tablespoons (275g) all-purpose flour, plus more for the muffin pan
1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoons baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
Pinch of ground nutmeg
2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature
3/4 cup granulated sugar
2 eggs, at room temperature
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup sour cream, at room temperature 
 
ASSEMBLY
1 cup granulated sugar 
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
Pinch of salt
2 sticks unsalted butter, melted → use for greasing muffin pan. 

Preheat oven to 375 degrees, with racks in the upper and lower third positions 

Melt two stick of butter in pan.

Combine dry ingredients (first 5 ingredients) in a mixing bowl.

Mix together cinnamon and sugar in another bowl.

Lightly grease muffin tins with melted butter and dust with flour, tapping and
rotating pan to evenly dust the cups

Beat two sticks of butter and 3/4 cup sugar for a few minutes until fluffy,
scraping down the bowl as needed. Add eggs one at a time, beating until eggs
are fully mixed into the batter, then mix in vanilla.  Mix in a third of the
flour mixture, followed by half of the sour cream, alternating ingredients
until everything is incorporated.  Mix in half of the remaining flour, followed
by the other half cup of sour cream, then finally the remaining flour mixture.

Drop a scant 2 oz of batter in each cup — smaller is better.

Bake for 20-25 minutes, rotating after 15 minutes

Cool for a couple of minutes, then unmold onto a cooling rack

Dunk each muffin into the butter, then roll in the cinnamon-sugar mix (use one
hand to dunk and the other to roll or your hands will covered in a sticky mess)
