Vegetarian Hungarian Paprikash
6 servings

Dumplings:
2 eggs
sea salt, to taste
6-7 tbsp whole wheat flour  (or more; the consistency has to be a little bit
                             thicker than sour cream)

Stew:
1 big carrot, sliced
2 onions, chopped
4 Capia peppers, chopped
1 400g can peeled tomatoes, chopped ; you can use fresh tomatoes also
2 tbsp whole wheat flour, dissolved in 1 glass of cold water
       (add flour first, then pour water over it)
1 bunch parsley, chopped
1 tsp ground pepper
1 tbsp sweet paprika
1/2 tsp hot paprika
2 tbsp oil
sea salt, to taste
2 bay leaves

Fill one pot with water and bring to a boil.  Whisk the egg whites until foamy.
Add egg yolks and salt.  Sprinkle one tbsp of flour at a time over the whisked
eggs and incorporate.  When the consistency is creamy you're done.

Place a glass filled with cold water right beside you.  Take about 1/2 tbsp of
dough and slowly place it in the boiling water. The dough will slip off the
tablespoon. Don't fill the whole tablespoon because the dumplings will double
their size.  Dip the tablespoon in the glass with cold water.  Repeat the
process.

Cover with a lid and let them boil over medium heat for 10 minutes.  When
ready, remove from heat and leave them in the pot until you finish the stew.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan.  Add chopped onion. Saute for 2-3 minutes.
Add chopped peppers and sliced carrots.  Add salt, pepper.  Pour over 1/2 cup
of water. (just enough to cover all ingredients).  Cover with a lid and cook
for about 10 minutes over medium heat.

Add chopped tomatoes, bay leaves and hot and sweet paprika.  Cook for another
10 minutes.  Add dissolved flour and stir for 2 minutes until incorporated.

Remove from heat and add chopped parsley.  Add dumplings and stir.
