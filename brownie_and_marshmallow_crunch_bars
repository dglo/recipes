Brownie & Marshmallow Crunch Bars

For the Brownie Base:
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate
2/3 cup unsalted
1 1/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips, divided
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. salt
4 large eggs, at room temperature
2 cups granulated sugar
2 tsp. vanilla extract

For the Toppings:
1 bag (10 1/2 ounces) miniature marshmallows
1 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips
1 cup smooth peanut butter
1 tbsp. unsalted butter
1 1/2 cups crisp rice cereal

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and grease a 9x13-inch pan.

For the brownies: In a medium saucepan, melt the unsweetened chocolate, butter,
& 3/4 cup of semisweet chocolate chips over medium heat, stirring occasionally
until melted. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes.

In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

In a large bowl , whisk the eggs thoroughly. Add the sugar and vanilla and
whisk until well combined. Stir the melted ingredients into the egg mixture
and mix well. Add in the dry ingredients and mix. Stir in the remaining 1/2
cup semisweet chocolate chips.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the surface with a spatula.
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the corner of the
pan comes out with moist crumbs.

Remove the brownies from the oven and immediately sprinkle the marshmallows
over the top. Return the pan to the oven for 3 more minutes.

Meanwhile place the milk chocolate chips, peanut butter, and 1 tablespoon of
butter in a medium saucepan and melt over low heat. Stir constantly until
completely melted the remove from heat. Add the crisp rice cereal and mix
well. Allow to cool for 3 minutes.

Spread the mixture evenly over the marshmallow layer and refrigerate until
chilled before cutting.  (These can be eaten cold or at room temperature.  We
preferred them at room temperature.)
