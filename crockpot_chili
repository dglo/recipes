SERVES 8

1 (11 ounce) can condensed black bean soup (or canned black beans in juice)
1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed (sometimes I use lentils)
1 (16 ounce) can vegetarian baked beans
1 (14 1/2 ounce) can chopped tomato puree (I use large 29 oz. can crushed tomatoes)
1 (15 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained
1 onion, chopped
1 green bell pepper, chopped
2 zucchini, chopped
2 stalks celery, chopped
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 (4 ounce) can diced chilies
1-2 jalapeno, chopped (depending on how much heat you want)
1 tablespoon chili powder
2 teaspoons cumin
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon cilantro (optional)

In a saucepan, saute the onion, bell pepper, zucchini, and celery for about 5 minutes.

In a slow cooker, combine black bean soup, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, baked beans, tomatoes, corn, onion, bell pepper, zucchini, jalapeno, chilies, and celery.  Season with garlic, chili powder, cumin, parsley, oregano, basil (and cilantro if using).  Cook for about 6 hours on low.

Serve with tortillas, cornbread, rice, or French bread.

This freezes well!  Leftovers are good on top of nachos!
