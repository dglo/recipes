Active Time: 25 mins
Total Time: 30 mins
Serves: 4

Cheddar Cheese Sauce:
8 ounces extra sharp cheddar cheese, grated
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1 (12-ounce) can evaporated milk
2 teaspoons Frank's Red Hot or other hot sauce

Roast Beef and Buns:
1 pound thinly sliced roast beef
4 pretzel buns or other rolls, split

Horseradish Sauce:
1/2 cup sour cream
1/2 cup prepared horseradish
2 tablespoons minced chives
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice from 1 lemon
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

For the Cheddar Cheese Sauce: Add grated cheese and cornstarch to a large bowl,
and toss until combined. Transfer to medium-sized saucepan. Pour in 1 cup
evaporated milk and the hot sauce. Cook over low heat, whisking occasionally,
until sauce is bubbly and homogenous, about 5 minutes. It will thicken
considerably as it warms up. Keep warm, thinning cheese sauce with additional
evaporated milk if it becomes too thick.

Meanwhile, for the Beef and Buns: Adjust racks to upper middle and lower
positions and preheat oven to 300Â°F. Place roast beef slices in a heatproof
dish, cover with aluminum foil, set on the bottom rack, and cook until warmed
through, about 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, wrap buns in aluminum foil, set on
top rack, and cook until warmed, about 5 minutes.

For the Horseradish Sauce: Add sour cream, horseradish, chives, and lemon
juice to a medium-sized bowl. Stir until combined. Season with salt and pepper.

Smear the cut-side of the bun bottoms with horseradish sauce, and top each with
1/4-pound of the sliced meat. Drizzle with some of the cheddar sauce and then
crown with top bun halves. Serve immediately.
