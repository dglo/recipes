Homemade Funfetti Cupcakes
makes 12-14 cupcakes

1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup milk
1/4 cup assorted colored sprinkles + more for sprinkling on frosting

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  Line a cupcake pan with liners.

Combine dry ingredients in a bowl and set aside.

In the bowl of an stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a
hand mixer, beat butter and sugar on medium-high until lightened in color and
fluffy, about 3 minutes.  Lower speed to medium and add eggs one at a time,
mixing well after each addition and scraping the bowl as needed.  Add vanilla
and mix until combined.

Reduce mixer speed to low and add the dry ingredients in two batches,
alternating with the milk and mixing just until incorporated.  Fold in
sprinkles with a rubber spatula.

Fill the cupcake liners about 2/3 full.  Bake for 15-18 minutes, or until a
toothpick inserted in center comes out clean.  Let cupcakes cool in pan for
5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.  

Frost with vanilla buttercream (recipe below) and top with sprinkles.

Vanilla Buttercream

2 sticks butter, softened but cool
3 cups powdered sugar, sifted
2 teaspoons clear vanilla extract (to help maintain bright white color)
1 tablespoon heavy cream or milk (if needed)

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or with a hand
mixer, cream butter on medium-high until fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.  Reduce
mixer speed to low and gradually add the powdered sugar.  Add in vanilla then
increase mixer speed to medium-high, beating 2-3 minutes and scraping the bowl
as needed.  If the frosting is too thick, add heavy cream or milk 1 teaspoon
at a time until desired consistency is reached.  If the frosting is to thin,
add powdered sugar 1/4 cup at a time until it thickens.

Frost cupcakes as desired and top with sprinkles.
