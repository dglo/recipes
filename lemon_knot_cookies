Grandma Babe's Lemon Knots

Store these tangy cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up
to one week. Don't be alarmed at the curdled appearance of the mixture at the
end of step two; the cookies turn out fine.

1/2 cup granulated sugar
6 tablespoons butter, softened
1 tablespoon finely grated lemon rind
1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
2 large eggs
3 cups flour (about 13 1/2 ounces)
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
Cooking spray

2 cups powdered sugar
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon low-fat buttermilk
Preparation

Preheat oven to 375 degrees.

To prepare cookies, place granulated sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat
with a mixer at medium speed 3 minutes or until light and fluffy. Beat in rind
and 1/4 cup juice. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition
(mixture will look curdled).

Lightly spoon flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine
flour, baking powder, and salt, stirring well with a whisk. Add flour mixture
to sugar mixture; stir with a wooden spoon to form a stiff dough. Turn dough
out onto a floured surface; knead 10 to 15 times to form a smooth dough.

Divide dough into 8 equal portions. Working with 1 portion at a time (cover
remaining dough to prevent drying), shape each portion into a 30-inch-long
rope; cut each rope crosswise into 6 (5-inch) pieces. Tie each dough piece
into a knot. Place knots on 2 baking sheets coated with cooking spray. Bake
1 sheet at a time at 375 degrees for 8 minutes or until bottoms of cookies are
lightly browned and tops are still pale. Remove cookies from pan; cool on wire
racks.

To prepare glaze, combine powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons juice, and buttermilk;
stir until smooth. Dip tops of cookies into glaze; dry on racks.
