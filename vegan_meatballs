Vegan "Meat" Balls
(Adapted from My Vegan Cookbook)

1/2 cup cooked lentil
1 cup cooked brown rice
1/4 cup oats
1/3 cup wheat germ
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons lemon juice
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon chili powder
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon maple syrup (could sub molasses)
1 teaspoons dry mustard

Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Combine all ingredients in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse until mixture
resembles texture and appearance of ground meat and most lentils are no longer
whole. Do not over mix.

Wet hands and form mixture into balls about 1-1/2" in diameter. You should get
around 16. Place on a baking sheet.

Bake in preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, turning once halfway through baking
time. Let rest for 10 minutes after baking to firm up.

These are pretty much endlessly customizable. If you aren't vegan, try
throwing in a handful of parmesan cheese (yum!). Want more summer flavor? Add
some fresh chopped basil and oregano. Looking for more of a cocktail meatball
taste? Up the maple syrup and toss the meatballs in your favorite barbecue
sauce.
