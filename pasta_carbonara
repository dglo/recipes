PREP TIME: 5 Minutes
COOK TIME: 20 Minutes
SERVINGS: 6 Servings

12 ounces, weight Pasta, Any Variety
8 pieces Thick Cut Bacon (diced Small)
1/2 whole Medium Onion, Diced Small
2 cloves Garlic, Minced
3 whole Eggs
3/4 cups Finely Grated Parmesan
3/4 cups Heavy Cream
Salt & Plenty Of Black Pepper
1/2 cup Peas

Cook pasta according to package directions. 

While the pasta is cooking, fry the bacon until just barely crisp. Remove from
the pan and drain on paper towels. Pour off all of the bacon grease, but don't
clean the pan. Return the pan to the stove over medium-low heat and throw in
the onions and garlic. Cook until golden brown. Set aside. 

In a bowl, mix together eggs, Parmesan, cream, and salt and pepper until
smooth. 

When the pasta is done, reserve a cup or two of the pasta water. Drain the
pasta and place it in a bowl. While the pasta is still really hot, slowly
drizzle in the egg mixture, stirring the pasta the whole time. The sauce will
become thick and should coat the pasta. Splash in a little hot pasta water if
needed for consistency.

Halfway through, add the peas, bacon, and sauteed onion/garlic. Finish adding
the sauce, stirring until it's all combined. 

Serve immediately with extra Parmesan.
