For the crust:

6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly,
  more for greasing the pan
20 graham crackers (about 310 grams)
1/4 cup/50 grams packed light or dark brown sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 large egg

For the topping:

1 14-ounce/397 gram can sweetened condensed milk 
8 ounces/227 grams chopped bittersweet chocolate (1 1/2 cups)
1 cup/110 grams chopped pecans
2 cups/114 grams unsweetened flaked coconut

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 13- by 9-inch baking pan. Line it with
parchment, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides.

In a food processor, process the graham crackers until finely ground. (You
should have about 2 3/4 cups.) Add brown sugar, baking powder and salt and
pulse to combine. While machine is running, add butter and egg and process
until the crumbs are completely moistened and large clumps have formed.

Tip the graham cracker mixture out into the prepared pan. Crumble the mixture
to divide it evenly across the bottom of the pan, then use your fingers to
spread it out into an even layer, lightly pressing it into the pan. Bake the
crust until it is set and dry, about 15 minutes.

Pour the sweetened condensed milk evenly over the crust and spread it out into
an even layer. Sprinkle half the chocolate and half the pecans evenly over the
surface. Sprinkle the coconut on in an even layer. Then sprinkle the remaining
chocolate and nuts evenly over the top.

Bake until toppings are evenly golden brown, about 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool
in the pan on a wire rack. To serve, lift the bar out of the pan using the
parchment overhang, transfer it to a cutting board and cut into 15 bars.
