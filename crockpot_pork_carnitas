Prep Time: 15 mins
Cook Time: 10 hours
Serves: 12 servings

4 lbs boneless pork shoulder
1 cup pineapple juice
juice of 1 lime
juice of 1 orange
1/4 onion, chopped
3 garlic cloves, smashed
2 tbsp taco seasoning
1/2 tbsp salt
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp crushed red pepper
1 tbsp garlic powder

In a large bowl, combine the pineapple juice, lime juice, orange juice, onion,
garlic, and spices. Mix everything together, then add the meat, and mix to
coat evenly.  Let the meat marinade for a few hours.

When ready, add the meat and marinade to your crockpot, and cook on high
for 4 hours, or low for 8 hours.  The longer you let the meat cook, the
better.  When meat is cooked through and falls apart easily, it is ready.

To crisp for serving, heat about 1 tbsp of oil in skillet over high heat.
Add pork (no more than half an inch or so) and sear until just beginning
to crisp.  Add some liquid from slow cooker and  continue cooking until
liquid begins to reduce and thicken.

Serve on corn torillas with cilantro, green onions, and cotija or other
crumbly white cheese.
