S'mores Bars
Gourmet | July 1990

Can be prepared in 45 minutes or less.
Makes about 24 bars.

2 cups graham cracker crumbs
1/3 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, melted
1 pound milk chocolate
4 cups mini-marshmallows

In a bowl combine well the crumbs, the sugar, the salt, and the butter and,
reserving 1 cup of the mixture, press the remaining mixture into the bottom of
a flameproof baking dish, 13 by 9 by 2 inches.

Bake the crust in a preheated 350 degree F. oven for 12 minutes, or until it
is golden, and let it cool in the dish on a rack.

In a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water melt the
chocolate, stirring, pour it over the crust spreading it evenly, and sprinkle
it with the marshmallows, pressing them lightly, and the reserved crumb
mixture.

Broil the dessert under a preheated broiler about 2 inches from the heat for
30 seconds, or until the marshmallows are golden, let it cool completely, and
cut it into squares.
