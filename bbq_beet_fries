Serves 3-4

3 Large Beets
1/2 Tsp Onion Powder
1/4 Tsp Garlic Powder
1/2 Tsp Dried Marjoram
1 Tsp Dried Oregano
Dash of Black Pepper
3 TB Homemade BBQ Sauce

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Wash the beets and then, without peeling them, cut the end off so the tips are
flat. Then cut each beet in half and then cut each in to thin wedges.

In a large bowl, combine all spices and sauce. Then coat all the beet wedges
in the mixture, making sure every side and slice is well and coated.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Then lay out each wedge and place
the sheet in the oven to bake for 15 minutes. Flip each wedge and bake for
another 15 minutes.

Remove and serve with BBQ sauce or ketchup
