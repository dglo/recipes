Figaretti's "Godfather II" Linguine
Recipe from Saveur: The New Comfort Food by James Oseland
Serves 2

Kosher salt, to taste
8 oz. dried linguine
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 small yellow onion, chopped
1/3 cup white wine
8 mussels, scrubbed and debearded
1/2 cup halved cherry tomatoes
2 tbsp. unsalted butter
8 large shrimp, peeled and deveined
8 leaves basil, torn, plus more for garnish
Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1/2 cup grated Asiago cheese
4 lemon wedges

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the linguine; cook
until al dente, 8-10 minutes. Drain the pasta; reserve 1/4 cup pasta water.

Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add
the green and red peppers, garlic, and onion; cook until they begin to soften,
about 3 minutes. Add the wine and the mussels; cook, covered, until the
mussels open, about 2 minutes. Add the reserved pasta water, tomatoes, butter,
and shrimp and cook, stirring, until the shrimp are just pink, about 1 minute.
Add the cooked linguine, toss to combine, and cook, stirring occasionally,
until the sauce thickens and clings to the pasta. Stir in the basil and season
with salt and pepper.

Divide pasta between 2 bowls. Sprinkle with more basil and Asiago and garnish
with lemon wedges
