Serves: 4

1 Tbsp unsalted butter
1 cup old-fashioned oatmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 Tbsp milled flax
1 1/2 Tbsp sugar
1/2 tsp salt
1 Tbsp baking powder
1 1/2 cup fat-free milk
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in large skillet over medium heat. Add oats and
stir frequently, cook until oats turn golden brown about 5 to 8 minutes, take
care not to burn. Oats will develop a "popcorn" aroma, that's when they are
done.

Place toasted oats in a food processor and process into fine meal, about
15-20 seconds. Add flour,flax, sugar, salt, and baking powder to oats and
pulse until combined, several quick pulses.

In a large bowl, lightly beat eggs. Add milk, butter and vanilla and whisk
until smooth.

With the whisk, gently fold half of oat mixture into wet ingredients. Add
remaining oat mixture and continue to fold with whisk until no lumps or flour
remain. Stir in cinnamon and set aside batter to thicken. While batter is
resting, heat waffle iron on low setting.

Lightly coat waffle iron with cooking spray. Fill waffle iron with batter,
gently spread to cover bottom. Close and cook according to manufacturer's
directions for a light coloring.

Serve warm.
