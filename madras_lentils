Prep Time: 1 hr
Total Time: 1 hr 30 mins
Servings: 2-4

2 cups cooked lentils
1 (15 ounce) cans crushed tomatoes
1 (15 ounce) cans red beans, rinsed
1/2 onion, diced
2 large garlic cloves
1 pinch salt
cayenne
1/8 cup olive oil or 1/8 cup canola oil
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 teaspoon chili powder
2 tablespoons green chilies
1/2 cup water, as needed
1/4 cup plain greek yogurt

Saute onion and garlic in some canola oil.

Add cumin, chili powder and cayenne, stir it in with the onions and garlic for
a couple minutes.

Add a can of crushed tomatoes (not drained). This is when you add the green
chilies if you use them.

Lower the heat and let it cook down for a bit. About 5-10min.

Add cooked lentils (cooked from dry) and red beans, no need to add water.

Add the salt, lower the heat and let it cook down until it thickened.

Add just the smallest amount (mixed into each serving of a maybe half tsp) of
plain fat free greek yogurt to give it a creamier texture.
