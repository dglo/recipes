Servings: 2
Cook/prep Time: 25 min

6 oz mafaldine pasta
6 oz broccoli florets, chopped into bite-size pieces
1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 yellow onion, peeled and diced
4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
13.76 oz crushed tomatoes
1 tsp Italian seasoning blend
1/4 to 2 tsp red chile flakes (as desired)
1/4 cup vegan basil pesto
2 tbsp vegan parmesan
1 tbsp + 2 tsp olive oil*
Salt
Pepper

Preheat oven to 425F. Bring large pot of salted water to a boil. Add mafaldine
and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta and return to pot, off
heat.

Combine broccoli, 1 tsp olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper on baking
sheet and toss. Roast until browned and crisp in places, 10 to 12 minutes.

Heat medium saucepan over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs, 2 tsp olive oil, and
1/4 tsp salt and stir frequently until breadcrumbs are golden brown, 2 to 4
minutes. Transfer toasted breadcrumbs to small bowl. Wipe saucepan clean.

Return same saucepan to medium-high heat with 2 tsp olive oil. Add onion,
garlic, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook until onion is softened, 3 to 5
minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, Italian seasoning blend, just 1/4 tsp red chile
flakes, and 1/2 tsp salt. Cook until sauce begins to simmer, 3 to 5 minutes.
(TIP: Add more red chile flakes if you prefer more spice.)

Add arrabbiata sauce to pot with mafaldine and stir. Divide mafaldine
arrabbiata between large bowls, ladling any remaining sauce over pasta. Serve
with roasted broccoli and top with toasted panko breadcrumbs, basil pesto, and
parmesan. Buon appetito!
